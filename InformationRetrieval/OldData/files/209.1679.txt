 In the 1976 and 1979 outbreaks in the cotton factory where the first cases of EBOV were employed, bats were known to roost. Only bats became infected when 24 plant species and 19 vertebrate species were experimentally inoculated with EBOV. The absence of clinical signs in these bats is characteristic of a reservoir species. In a 2002â€“2003 survey of 1,030 animals including 679 bats from Gabon and the Republic of the Congo, 13 fruit bats were found to contain EBOV RNA fragments. As of 2005, three types of fruit bats (Hypsignathus monstrosus, Epomops franqueti, and Myonycteris torquata) have been identified as being in contact with EBOV. They are now suspected to represent the EBOV reservoir hosts. Antibodies against Ebola Zaire and Reston viruses have been found in fruit bats in Bangladesh, thus identifying potential virus hosts and signs of the filoviruses in Asia.
