90 per cent of cholera cases are mild. Many infected people have no symptoms, but can be carriers and infect others. 
Even in a cholera outbreak, more children die from other types of diarrhoea. 
The main danger from cholera is rapid dehydration. It must be treated quickly. Unless patients receive rehydration they can die, sometimes in a few hours. 
Most cholera cases can be treated successfully with oral rehydration therapy. However, the few that become severely dehydrated need intravenous fluid initially and antibiotic treatment. 
Neither vaccination, quarantine, nor travel restrictions prevent cholera from spreading. 
In the long term, improved water supply, sanitation and hygiene, and better living conditions are crucial to preventing cholera.
