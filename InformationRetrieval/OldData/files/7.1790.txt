One week following treatment, a stool culture is taken from asymptomatic patients to check that these infections have cleared. If the sample is positive, strict hygiene procedures need to be continued, and retreatment may be necessary. If the patient is in a 'risk group' (see 'Risk groups', below) re-treatment, exclusion, redeployment and bacteriological surveillance are needed until there have been three negative clearance faecal samples taken at least 48 hours apart.[9]Ciprofloxacin 750 mg bd and norfloxacin 400 mg bd have both been effective in the past. This may remain effective treatment in cases where Africa or South America was the source of infection. Where the source is Southeast Asia, however, newer quinolones such as gatifloxacin, ampicillin, amoxicillin with probenecid or co-trimoxazole have been used.[16] (Discuss with microbiologist).Long-term urinary carriers should be assessed for urinary tract abnormalities, including schistosomiasis.In long-term faecal carriage, cholecystectomy is not very effective, as the liver is a reservoir.
