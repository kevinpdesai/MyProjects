It is difficult to tell whether a sickness is caused by malaria or some other disease, because the features may
be similar. Ask the patient, or the adult accompanying a young patient, whether there has been any fever at any
time during the past 2-3 days. The patient has a fever when the forehead feels hot, or more precisely when his
or her temperature is more than 37.5 degrees centigrade on a thermometer. Very young children with malaria
may present with low body temperatures or hypothermia. Patients who have had fever during the last 2-3 days
may have malaria. In this case, ask and then look for danger signs.
