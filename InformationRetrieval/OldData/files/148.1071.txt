The CDC recommends to “Boil it, cook it, peel it, or forget it”. Individuals living or traveling to places where cholera is found should drink boiled or chlorine- or iodine-treated water or bottled beverage. Foods should be thoroughly cooked, and individuals should peel their own fruits. Also, avoid ice, raw foods, and ice cream. Be wary of foods and beverages from street vendors.
