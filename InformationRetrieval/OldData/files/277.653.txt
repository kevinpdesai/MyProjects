To accurately assess the burden of simian malaria in humans imported to the United States, molecular testing on all malaria specimens from Asia and non-falciparum specimens from South America is needed. Health-care providers of patients with malaria and laboratories that diagnose a case of malaria imported from Asia or non-falciparum malaria from South America can refer appropriate specimens for species confirmation and assessment for imported simian malaria. CDC Malaria Branch accepts specimens and offers to perform these tests.
