The ability of clinicians to suspect and diagnose murine typhus before receiving the results of confirmatory serologic tests will remain a challenge, because physician awareness of this infection is limited as a result of murine typhus' regional geographic setting and nonspecific clinical presentation. However, murine typhus should be considered in the differential diagnosis if a patient presents with persistent fever of 3–5 days' duration without explanation, if a history of exposure to opossum or cats (in southern California and Texas) and flea contact is likely, or if there is a history of travel to tropical or semitropical environments where large rat populations are likely to exist. Empirical treatment with doxycycline should be started while laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis is pending. All suspected cases of murine typhus should be promptly reported to the local health department because of the potential for spread.
