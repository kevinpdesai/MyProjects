We are fortunate in Orlando to have two extraordinarily competent hospital systems and an excellent emergency-medical-services system that enjoys impressive support from the state government, resulting from years of, among other things, hurricane preparedness. We are confident that our emergency departments are gearing up to and are prepared to safely care for any Ebola patients who may show up at our door, without jeopardizing the well being of the rest of our patients.The question is, why not make this task easier by limiting our exposure with preventive care?
