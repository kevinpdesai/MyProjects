Practice good hygiene. Prison camps and other facilities that promote sub-standard living conditions have historically been large rickettsiae breeders. World War II concentrations camps like Bergen Belson and Terezin were overwrought with typhus and a large part of the mortality rate in these places was due to the illness. Lack of hygiene promotes conditions such as body and head lice, which breed the disease. Wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants can also help prevent the spread of typhus.Take antibiotics. Although the mortality rate of the disease is between 10 and 60 percent, these numbers can be drastically reduced if antibiotics are administered in the early stages of the illness. Doctors prescribe doxycycline and chloramphenical to eradicate the bacteria and cure the patient.
