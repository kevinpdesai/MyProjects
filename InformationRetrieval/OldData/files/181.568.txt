In Louisiana, state officials wouldn’t allow anyone who has traveled to “Liberia, Sierra Leone, or Guinea in the past 21 days or [who] has treated Ebola patients elsewhere” to attend the prestigious meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, which took place on November 1st, 2014. Participants of the conference immediately responded to this outlaw with an outcry. In an article from Science Magazine, Daniel Baush who organized a “specialized Ebola symposia” for the conference stated, “This policy is fundamentally flawed and not evidence-based.” Another representative, Peter Hotez stated, “It’s very unfortunate and could potentially be counterproductive by preventing health care workers from Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea from sharing their experiences and findings at one of the most important tropical disease meetings globally.”
