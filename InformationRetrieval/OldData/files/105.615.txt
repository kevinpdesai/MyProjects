The most common error in caring for patients with cholera is to underestimate the speed and volume of fluids required.[39] In most cases, cholera can be successfully treated with oral rehydration therapy (ORT), which is highly effective, safe, and simple to administer.[24] Rice-based solutions are preferred to glucose-based ones due to greater efficiency.[24] In severe cases with significant dehydration, intravenous rehydration may be necessary. Ringer's lactate is the preferred solution, often with added potassium.[11][37] Large volumes and continued replacement until diarrhea has subsided may be needed.[11] Ten percent of a person's body weight in fluid may need to be given in the first two to four hours.[11] This method was first tried on a mass scale during the Bangladesh Liberation War, and was found to have much success.[40]

If commercially produced oral rehydration solutions are too expensive or difficult to obtain, solutions can be made. One such recipe calls for 1 liter of boiled water, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 6 teaspoons of sugar, and added mashed banana for potassium and to improve taste
