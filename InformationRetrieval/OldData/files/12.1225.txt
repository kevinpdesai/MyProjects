Symptoms appear an average of 60 to 90 days after you have contact with the virus (incubation period). But they can appear as soon as 45 days to as late as 180 days after contact. Blood, semen, and vaginal fluids, whether fresh or dried, are highly contagious during this period and for several weeks after the start of symptoms.
