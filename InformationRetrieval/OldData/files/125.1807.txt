Treatment of cholera typically consists of aggressive rehydration to replace lost fluids and electrolytes with commercial or hand-mixed sugar-salt solutions. A 1 teaspoon (tsp) salt + 8 tsp sugar in 1 liter of clean/boiled water is commonly used. This simple and cost-effective solution created by the World Health Organization for oral rehydration has proven useful as a treatment method not only for cholera but other similar diseases. Massive injections of liquid given intravenously via an IV are used in advanced cases of dehydration. Without rehydration, the death rate can be as high as 10-50 percent, due to the serious dehydration that cholera produces.
