Using data supplied by the WHO, several studies have estimated the reproduction number of the EVD epidemic in West Africa between 1.2 and 2.5, with variations between countries and time during the outbreak. The basic reproduction number of EVD together with its generation time, which is the time between initial infection and transmission to others, cause the cumulative number of infected cases to double every two to three weeks in some affected areas.
