Fortunately, full recovery from malaria is possible, with the help of prescription medicines and antibiotics. The type of drug that is used in the treatment depends on the malarial parasite that led to the infection, as well as the severity of the illness. A doctor may choose to dispense the medicines in the form of pills or even through an IV line. Unfortunately, it can take a person weeks or even months in recovering from malaria completely.
