Typhus infection can be effectively prevented through flea control measures on pets, especially domesticated cats. Foliage in the yard should be trimmed so that it does not provide harborage for rodents, opossums, and stray or feral cats. Screens should be placed on windows and crawl spaces to prevent entry of animals into the house. Food sources, such as open trash cans, fallen food, and pet food that could encourage wild animals to take up residence around the home should be eliminated
