To replace fluids lost through severe diarrhoea, 36 patients (97%) received oral rehydration solution. Additional intravenous fluid resuscitation was given to 28 (76%) patients.
One patient with acute kidney injury, probably caused by profound diarrhoea-related dehydration, improved following the administration of approximately 5 litres of intravenous crystalloid fluids per day for 3 days.
