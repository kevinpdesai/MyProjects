Illness usually starts suddenly with headache, chills, prostration, fever, and generalized
body aches. A macular eruption appears in four to seven days, initially on the upper trunk, followed by
spread to the entire body, but usually not to the face, palms, or soles. The rash starts as maculopapular,
becomes petechial or hemorrhagic, then develops into brownish-pigmented areas. The rash may be more
concentrated in the axillae. Changes in mental status are common with delirium or coma. Toxemia is
usually pronounced. Myocardial and renal failure can occur when the disease is severe. When untreated,
the fever and illness last for 2 weeks.
