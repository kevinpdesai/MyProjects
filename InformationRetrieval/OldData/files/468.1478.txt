The two key objectives of the study were, first, to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a recombinant antigen-based malarial enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) and, second, to estimate the risk associated with implementing this test with a shortened cellular component restriction period (6 months rather than the standard 12-36 months) for blood donors with a malarial risk exposure.
