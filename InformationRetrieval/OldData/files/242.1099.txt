The second preventative prong is protecting the body from insect bites. Wearing heavy clothing when venturing into potentially insect-laden areas is one way to protect against insect bites; applying insect repellent to the skin is another. Proper personal hygiene, such as frequent bathing and changing of clothes, will eliminate human body lice and thus prevent epidemic typhus. A typhus vaccine is also available; however, this vaccine only lessens the severity and shortens the course of the disease, and does not protect against infection.
