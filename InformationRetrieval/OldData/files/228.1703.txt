No human organ is directly affected by the bacterium responsible for causing cholera (Vibrio cholerae). This bacterium produces an exotoxin which causes cells in the intestine to excrete large amounts of water, producing a watery, and classically "rice-water" diarrhea. It is the toxin that causes the problem, not the bacterium, per se.
