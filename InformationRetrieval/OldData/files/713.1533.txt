Endemic typhus is usually transmitted to humans by flea feces or animal droppings containing R. typhi or R. felis. The flea or louse bite causes itching and scratching and may allow the bacteria to enter the scratch or bite area in the skin. Indirect person-to-person transmission can occur if lice or fleas infect one person who develops the disease and then the infected lice or fleas move from person to person by direct contact or via shared clothing.
