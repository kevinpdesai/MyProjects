In patients with appropriate travel history malaria remains the most likely cause of febrile illness, although this does not rule out the presence of additional disease. A list of diagnoses to consider in the returning traveller with febrile illness, abdominal pain, neurological symptoms and rashes should include:Malaria.Amoebiasis.Influenza.Tuberculosis.Typhus.Viral haemorrhagic fever - eg, Ebola.Dengue fever.Non-typhoid infection with Salmonella spp.Campylobacter.Cholera.Typhus.Scrub typhus.Tuberculosis.Abdominal abscess.Yellow fever.African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness).InvestigationsOrganism cultureDiagnosis is made by culturing the organism. This may be obtained from stool or other sources.Blood cultures are only positive in 40-60% of cases.[12] However, this may be enhanced to above 80% using two sets of blood cultures and modern methods.[13]The most sensitive source (90% isolation rate) is bone marrow aspiration.Isolation of S. typhi is highest in the first week and becomes more difficult as time passes.SerologyThe traditional serological test is Widal's test. It measures agglutinating antibodies against flagellar (H) and somatic (O) antigens of S. typhi.High or rising O antibody titres generally indicate acute infection, whereas H antibody is used to identify the type of infection.The test is positive on admission in between 40-60% of patients but the test has enormous variation between laboratories in terms of sensitivity, specificity and predictive value.The validity of rapid diagnostic tests for typhoid and paratyphoid was submitted for Cochrane review in 2010.[14]Management
