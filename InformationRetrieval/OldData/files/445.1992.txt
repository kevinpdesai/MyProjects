We normally encourage travellers to make an appointment 8 weeks before travel. This is because some vaccinations take some time to take effect, you may need one to test malaria tablets, and some vaccines require a course of injections.
If you know you are travelling but don't know when or where, you can still get basic vaccinations - it is never too late to plan for a healthy journey.
