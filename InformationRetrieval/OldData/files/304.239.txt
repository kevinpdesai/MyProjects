What Is the History of Ebola?
Ebola hemorrhagic fever (also just called Ebola or EHF) is a highly contagious illness and is often fatal in nonhuman primates (chimpanzees, monkeys, and gorillas) as well as humans. The cause of outbreaks is an infection with the Ebola virus (see Ebola Pictures). The virus got its name from a river in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire) in Africa, where it was first recognized.
