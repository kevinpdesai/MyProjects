Cerebral malaria is characterized by an impaired consciousness (Box). The presenting symptoms are severe headache followed by drowsiness, confusion, and ultimately coma. Convulsions are also frequently associated with cerebral malaria. These neurological manifestations are believed to be due to the sequestration of the infected erythrocytes in the cerebral microvasculature. Sequestration refers to the cytoadherence of trophozoite- and schizont-infected erythrocytes to endothelial cells of deep vascular beds in vital organs, especially brain, lung, gut, heart and placenta. This sequestration provides several advantages for the parasite. The major advantage is the avoidance of the spleen and the subsequent elimination of infected erythrocytes. In addition, the low oxygen tensions in the deep tissues may provide a better metabolic environment.
