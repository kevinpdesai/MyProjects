Plasmodium malariae may cause persistent infections, although there is no liver dormant stage. Infected individuals are frequently asymptomatic and the parasite has been associated with blood transfusion acquired malaria in the United States years after migration. Since this organism is not common and will generally respond to currently recommended presumptive therapy for P. falciparum there are no additional recommendations for this infection.
