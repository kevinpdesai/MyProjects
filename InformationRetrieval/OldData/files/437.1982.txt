Disease is spread by human body lice infected with the bacteria that cause epidemic typhus fever. The
disease is most common during the winter, when conditions favor person-to-person spread of body lice.
Human body lice become infected when they feed on the blood of a person with epidemic typhus fever.
Infected lice then pass infectious feces when they feed. People become infected when infected lice
feces or crushed infected body lice are rubbed into small cuts on the skin, such as those caused by
scratching the bite site. It is the feces, not the bite of the louse that spreads illness to humans. The
disease may also be spread when a person breathes in infected dried lice feces in dust. The way that the
disease is spread from flying squirrels to humans is not well understood.
