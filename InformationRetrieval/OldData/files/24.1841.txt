Currently a PUI for EVD is defined as illness in a person who has both consistent symptoms and risk factors as follows: 1) Clinical criteria, which include elevated body temperature or subjective fever or additional symptoms such as severe headache, fatigue, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or unexplained hemorrhage; AND 2) epidemiologic risk factors within the past 21 days before the onset of symptoms, such as contact with blood or other body fluids of a PUI or patient with confirmed EVD; residence in—or travel to—a country with widespread transmission or cases in urban settings with uncertain control measures; participation in funeral and burial rituals, or direct handling of bats, rodents, or primates from disease-endemic areas.
