To prevent typhus, you should avoid exposing yourself to the illness by avoiding fleas, ticks, mites, and lice that carry the bacteria. Wear bug spray if you are going to be in an area where there could be ticks or fleas. Avoid unsanitary conditions where there could be lice. If you think you have been exposed to lice, wash clothing and bedding in extremely hot water to kill the lice.
