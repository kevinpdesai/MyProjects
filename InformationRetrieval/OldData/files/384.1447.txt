The lifetime risk of developing disease, the incubation period, and the time period between infection and transmission (the serial interval) are three important measures for interpreting trends in tuberculous infection and disease but are complicated by strong age dependencies regarding disease risk and by the potential for reinfection to occur. By using a model of the epidemiology of tuberculosis in England and Wales, the authors demonstrated that all three measures changed dramatically during the 20th century largely as a result of declines in the risk of infection.
