A milder form of disease compared to epidemic typhus. It occurs globally - in temperate climates, usually during the summer months and, in tropical countries, throughout the year. It remains fairly widespread, including parts of the USA. Homelessness, poverty and situations which promote close contact between rats and people favour its spread.
