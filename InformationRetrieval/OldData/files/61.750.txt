If malaria is diagnosed and treated promptly, a full recovery can be expected. Treatment should be started as soon as a blood test confirms malaria.
Many of the same antimalarial medicines used to prevent malaria can also be used to treat malaria. However, if you have taken an antimalarial to prevent malaria, you should not take the same one to treat malaria if you still become infected. Therefore, it is important to tell the doctor treating you the name of the tablets that you took to help prevent infection.
The type of antimalarial medicine and how long you need to take it will depend on:
the type of malaria you have
where you caught malaria
the severity of your symptoms
whether you took preventative antimalarial tablets
your age
whether you are pregnant
