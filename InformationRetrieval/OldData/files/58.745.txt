Restricting malaria treatment to patients with parasitologically confirmed malaria infection has become increasingly important in the era of artemisininbased combination therapy (ACT). This importance is reflected in the World Health Organization's new recommendation: “Prompt parasitological confirmation by microscopy or alternatively by RDTs is recommended in all patients suspected of malaria before treatment is started. Treatment solely on the basis of clinical suspicion should only be considered when a parasitological diagnosis is not accessible”. The rationale for this is that unnecessary antimalarial treatment will put non-malaria-infected patients at risk of adverse drug events and, importantly, also will increase the exposure of low residual concentrations of the slowly eliminated partner drugs in ACT to infecting parasites, with potential selection of drug tolerance and resistance .Moreover, unnecessary presumptive ACT treatment is costly and may prevent other causes of fever from being considered, being identified, and being appropriately treated. Thus, improved and welltargeted antimalarial treatmentmay result in overall better health outcome, which in turn could support the credibility of recommended treatment policies (eg, the recently introduced ACTs). These aspects apply especially in areas with low prevalence of malaria.
