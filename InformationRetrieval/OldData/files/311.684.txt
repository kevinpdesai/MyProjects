Recently, the term “supportive care” has appeared in news releases in relation to the treatment of Ebola virus victims without providing much information on the specifics of this treatment.  Actually, supportive care has more than one context in medicine.  For example, in terminal cancer, supportive care, also known as palliative care, focuses on relieving suffering and improving quality of life instead of seeking to cure the patient.  Ebola virus infections, like several other infections including Rabies, tetanus, and even the common cold, has no effective antiviral or antimicrobial treatment.  To a large degree, recovery of these infections relies on the body’s immune system.  With Ebola and Rabies, however, the disease is often fatal because the infection overwhelms the body’s immune system.  In these cases, supportive care means that measures are taken to address complications of the illness, such as blood loss, low blood pressure, dehydration, or low oxygen level.  This helps to buy precious time until the immune system is able to recover adequately to begin fighting the infection.
