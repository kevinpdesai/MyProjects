Here we are speaking of quarantine at the point of entry into our country. This is not a new concept in the United States. The legal basis for quarantine is well established. The authority to employ it lies with the CDC. There are currently 20 designated quarantine stations in the United States located in most major travel hubs. This system has successfully defended America from infective agents since the late 1800s. We believe it is time for the CDC to invoke a mandatory quarantine of 21 days on anyone with recent travel from those countries where the Ebola virus is active. Quarantine at this stage would ensure that no one who is potentially harboring the virus and is in the incubation period would be missed.
