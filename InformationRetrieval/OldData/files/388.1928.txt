Regarding doxycycline, it’s great that your daughter took it religiously—that is certainly the first step towards protection. Randomized placebo controlled trials have shown it is between 92-96% effective in preventing P. falciparum malaria, which is very good, but obviously not 100% perfect – even when taken perfectly, some infections do occur. In addition, there is some data which suggests that dairy products, taken together with doxycycline, may limit  the uptake of the drug. This is rarely communicated to patients, who are instead contrarily told sometimes that taking the pills together with dairy products can reduce side effects! As such, please let your daughter know that she should avoid dairy products for 2-3 hours around the time she takes her doxycycline.
