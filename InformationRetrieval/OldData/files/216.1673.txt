The flu-like symptoms typically occur in the first stages of the illness, before the person gets sicker and starts to experience more severe symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea and low blood pressure. The extreme bleeding occurs toward the end of the illness. People who die from infection with Ebola virus usually end up dying from multi-organ failure and shock. "The shock is from the bleeding -- now you're bleeding in different parts of your body, and the blood is leaking out of your blood vessels," Bhadelia explained. "Even if [you don't have] the hemorrhagic features, you're still leaking blood."
