Malaria can often be avoided using the ABCD approach to prevention which stands for:
Awareness of risk – find out whether you are at risk of getting malaria.
Bite prevention – avoid mosquito bites by using insect repellent, covering your arms and legs and using a mosquito net.
Check whether you need to take malaria prevention tablets – if you do, make sure you take the right antimalarial tablets at the right dose, and finish the course.
Diagnosis – seek immediate medical advice if you have malaria symptoms, including up to a year after you return from travelling.
