Human waste must be kept from entering any water supply. That would include wells, other groundwater, streams, lakes, ponds and rivers. It can continue to live in most water once it gets into the supply. The diarrhea caused by cholera is very runny and if not contained, can easily end up in a water supply somewhere. Fish and shellfish can carry cholera and must be thoroughly cooked.
