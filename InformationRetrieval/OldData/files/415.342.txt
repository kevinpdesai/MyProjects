The experimental antiviral drug BCX-4430, manufactured by BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, has been awarded funding from the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to commence trials against Ebola in non-human primates. It works by interfering with viral replication. Early results seem to show some efficacy in non-human primates but safety trials in human volunteers have yet to be published by the NIAID.
