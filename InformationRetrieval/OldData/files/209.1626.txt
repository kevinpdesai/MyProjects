 As of August 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) also reported an outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) which lies in Central Africa. The WHO confirmed that the current strain of the virus is the Zaire Ebola species, which is common in the DRC. The virology results and epidemiological findings indicate no connection to the current epidemic in West Africa (i.e. the index case and her contacts had no history of travel to the Ebola ravaged countries in Western Africa or history of contact with individuals from the affected areas). This is the DRC's seventh Ebola outbreak since 1976.
