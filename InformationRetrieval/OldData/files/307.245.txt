The treatment, in fact, is nearly as old as the disease itself. Peter Piot of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who discovered Ebola in 1976 in Zaire, said the idea even back then was promising. “We had only one possible treatment option in the form of serum from convalescents who had very high levels of antibodies,” he explained to Science. The blood was later used to treat a researcher in Britain who infected himself while drawing blood from an Ebola-infected guinea pig. He survived.
