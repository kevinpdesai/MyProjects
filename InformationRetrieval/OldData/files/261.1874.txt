The four main types of typhus are:
epidemic typhus
Brill-Zinsser disease
endemic or murine typhus
scrub typhus
These diseases are all somewhat similar, although they vary in terms of severity. The specific type of Rickettsia that causes the disease also varies, as does the specific insect that can pass the bacteria along.
