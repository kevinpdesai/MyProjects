The other genus, Ebola virus, was first recognized when two outbreaks occurred in Zaire and in Sudan in 1976 [1]. Outbreaks of Ebola virus disease have been confined to Sub-Saharan Africa. An epidemic caused by the Zaire species caused several hundred cases in 1995 in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Sudan virus infected more than 400 people in Gulu, Uganda in 2000.
