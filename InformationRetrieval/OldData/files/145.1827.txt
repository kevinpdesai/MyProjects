The possible treatments for chloroquine-resistant infections include the combination of quinidine or quinine plus doxycycline, tetracycline or clindamycin, mefloquine or artesunate and the combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine (Fansidar). The treatment option of medication partly depends on where and when you were infected.
