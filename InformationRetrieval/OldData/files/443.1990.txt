Treatment of cholera can be very simple and effective, especially if it is given soon after symptoms appear. Rehydration, or replenishing the body with fluids, is the most important part of treatment. This can be accomplished most effectively by drinking a mixture of sugar, salts, and clean water, known as an oral rehydration solution. The World Health Organization has an oral rehydration solution that is distributed worldwide through the efforts of the United Nations. In the United States, solutions can be bought or mixed at home. Such solutions replenish the fluid and salts lost by the body due to diarrhea and vomiting.
