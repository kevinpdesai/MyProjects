In mid-September the sale of black market blood from survivors of the disease had become a new trend in the Ebola-affected regions. Serum derived blood from surviving victims has been used under strict control in certain cases. This trend in an uncontrolled manner could potentially lead to other infectious diseases. This treatment must be properly implemented as a medical treatment under strict control and screening of possible donors. Margaret Chan of the WHO has criticized the use of this practice in a black market environment, noting concerns over "storage and collection methods".
