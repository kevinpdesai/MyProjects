Typhus fevers are most common in areas with poor sanitation and in people with poor personal hygiene. Not surprisingly, outbreaks of typhus are often associated with war, famine, poverty, and areas populated by people with poor quality of life. The typhus fever that decimated the Aztecs was brought to the New World by the body lice infesting the Spanish sailors, who were unable to consistently clean themselves while on ship. Soldiers typically living in crowded, dirty conditions are especially susceptible to outbreaks of fleas, lice, and mites carrying Rickettsia. Today, typhus impacts refugee camps and poor, third-world countries.
