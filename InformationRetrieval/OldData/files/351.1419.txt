In the case of malaria, the incubation period for the disease (the period between infection and the beginning of symptoms) typically lasts between 10 days to four weeks. In some cases, the malaria incubation period may be as short as seven days or as long as several years. Factors that affect the incubation period for malaria include the type of Plasmodium parasite responsible for the infection. When antimalarial drugs are used to prevent the spread of the disease, they may also increase the length of the malaria incubation period by weeks or months.
