Cholera Toxin causes life threatening diarrhoea. The toxin opens the CFTr (Cyctic Fibrosis Transporter) which secretes Cl- ions. They bring Na+ out of the epithelial cells, which causes water to leave the cells too. No water absorption happens and the person gets VERY dehyrdated. Easily fix however, with oral rehyrdration using saline.
