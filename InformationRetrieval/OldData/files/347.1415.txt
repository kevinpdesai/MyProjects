Thomas Duncan, the first person diagnosed with the Ebola virus in the United States, is in isolation in a Dallas hospital, and the family he stayed with is now in quarantine in an apartment complex north of downtown Dallas. That means the family has been ordered not to leave their home and is banned from hosting any visitors until the 21-day incubation period for Ebola has passed. While they are in quarantine, police are surveying the building and necessities are being delivered to the family. Updated 4:36 pm ET: The Dallas County Fire Marshall says that four people who are quarantined will soon be moved to another location, Reuters reports. Quarantine is a legal move as much as it is a public health tool. Under the Texas Health and Safety Code, police can charge the family with a third-degree felony should they leave the apartment.
