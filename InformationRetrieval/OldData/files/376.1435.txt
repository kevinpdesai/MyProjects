The incubation period is the time from ingesting the germs (bacteria) until the time you actually start to feel ill. It depends on how many bacteria you have swallowed. It is usually between seven and fourteen days, but can be as short as three days, or as long as 30 days. Untreated, the illness usually lasts for three to four weeks, but may be longer in a small number of cases. Symptoms vary from mild to severe and life-threatening. Lack of fluid in the body (dehydration) is a risk. About 1 in 300 people infected with typhoid fever may have a low-grade infection. They may not develop any significant symptoms, and then become carriers of the disease.
