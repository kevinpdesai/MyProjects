ZMapp is one experimental treatment for Ebola. This treatment contains three monoclonal antibodies that may bind to the virus, so that the immune system can clear out the virus. "So far, the published work indicates that ZMapp can cure monkeys up to five days after they've been given a lethal dose of Ebola virus," Lai said.
