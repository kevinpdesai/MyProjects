In the month of November, 1914, typhus
killed 200,000 Serbian soldiers on the front, almost one-quarter of their entire armed forces, and
spread to the rest of the population in the south. Out of 400 physicians in the country, 126
succumbed to typhus while caring for the patients in the few poorly-equipped hospitals available.
