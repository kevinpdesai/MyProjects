Malaria is a potentially fatal illness. People planning to travel to an area with malaria should see their physician before travel, preferably at least six weeks before departure. Travelers should use mosquito precautions and take medications to reduce the risk of disease.Mosquito precautions include wearing light, protective clothing and using window screens and bed nets when available. The mosquito that spreads malaria is active between dusk and dawn. Insect repellants should be used and should contain DEET. Room sprays may be used to reduce the mosquito population in sleeping areas.
