Cholera affects an estimated 3–5 million people worldwide, and causes 58,000–130,000 deaths a year as of 2010.[2][8] This occurs mainly in the developing world.[53] In the early 1980s, death rates are believed to have been greater than 3 million a year.[11] It is difficult to calculate exact numbers of cases, as many go unreported due to concerns that an outbreak may have a negative impact on the tourism of a country.[24] Cholera remains both epidemic and endemic in many areas of the world.
