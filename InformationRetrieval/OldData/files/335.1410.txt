In both cases, data gathered by the World Health Organization reported a 2-21 day incubation period for the virus –meaning that after 21 days if the individual hasn’t presented symptoms they are likely not to be infected or contagious. This is likely the genesis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s 21-day quarantine period, but there is little indication from the CDC as to what other considerations played into this policy. “Twenty-one days has been regarded as the appropriate quarantine period for holding individuals potentially exposed to Ebola Virus to reduce risk of contagion, but there does not appear to be a systemic discussion of the basis for this period,” said Haas, who is the head of the Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering Department at Drexel.
