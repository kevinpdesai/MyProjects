One vaccine comes from Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, Manitoba. That lab announced last week it will make available 800 to 1,000 doses of a vaccine that worked well in monkeys. U.S. government labs and the drug company GlaxoSmithKline are preparing a second vaccine for human safety tests.
