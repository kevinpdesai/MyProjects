You get cholera from eating tiny amounts of poop from someone who has it. It is not airborne. That’s why clean water and effective sanitation, and hygiene keep it from spreading in “developed” countries. Cholera can survive in standing water and can be transmitted in bilge water of ships and other water sources. It is essential to filter or otherwise decontaminate water before using it.
