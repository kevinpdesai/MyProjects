So, contrary to what the media are currently saying, Ebola HAS been in the United States. The Reston epidemic was miraculously contained, and it was found that the strain of Ebola was slightly different from the original Ebola Zaire from the first outbreak in 1976. In the Reston case, not only did many monkeys in the facility die of Ebola, but some of the animal care staff perished of the disease as well.
