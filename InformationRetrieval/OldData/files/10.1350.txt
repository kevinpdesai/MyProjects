 In addition, implementation of blood safety strategies, including quality-assured screening of all donated blood and blood components used for transfusion can prevent transmission of hepatitis B virus. Safe injection practices, eliminating unnecessary and unsafe injections, can be effective strategies to protect against HBV transmission. Furthermore, safer sex practices, including minimizing the number of partners and using barrier protective measures (condoms), also protect against transmission.
