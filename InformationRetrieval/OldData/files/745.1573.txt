That's the reality for the friends of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first victim of Ebola to die in the United States, who made contact with him before his hospital admission. According to NPR, the family that made contact with Duncan "has been ordered not to leave their home and is banned from hosting any visitors until the 21-day quarantine period for Ebola has passed." So does that mean that on the 22nd day, they are in the clear, completely safe from contracting Ebola?
