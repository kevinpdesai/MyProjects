There would be no crisis if drugs and vaccines to combat the disease were available to use, but none exist yet. Thus, the current Ebola epidemic requires specific measures to prevent the spread of the disease. Isolation and quarantine, two traditional measures of controlling disease can be used effectively to control Ebola, along with careful monitoring. Isolation is the voluntary act of avoiding any contact with the outside world for the designated period. Monitoring can be performed by the individual possibly affected or by another person and has been used in this epidemic with efficacy. Quarantine is the mandatory isolation from any contact with the outside world with professional monitoring. Thus quarantine is a coercive process used by governments in emergencies to safeguard public health and safety.
