In Hong Kong, urban typhus has been a notifiable disease since
1951. All registered medical practitioners are required to report suspected or
confirmed cases to the CHP for investigation and public health control
measures. Cases are defined as persons with compatible clinical features and
laboratory confirmation. CHP continues to monitor the trend of the disease and
disease statistics are uploaded to CHP’s website regularly.
