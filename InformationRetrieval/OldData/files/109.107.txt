Ebola is one of several viruses that can cause Viral Hemorrhagic Fever.  The first Ebolavirus species was discovered in 1976 in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near the Ebola River. Since then, outbreaks have occurred sporadically, mainly in West and Central Africa.  Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) has a high mortality rate and there is no treatment proven to be effective, although experimental treatment for EVD is undergoing evaluation.
