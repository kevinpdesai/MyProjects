The first description of typhus was probably given in 1083 at La Cava abbey near Salerno, Italy.[7][8] In 1546, Girolamo Fracastoro, a Florentine physician, described typhus in his famous treatise on viruses and contagion, De Contagione et Contagiosis Morbis.[9]
Before a vaccine was developed during World War II, typhus was a devastating disease for humans and has been responsible for a number of epidemics throughout history.[10] These epidemics tend to follow wars, famine, and other conditions that result in mass casualties.
