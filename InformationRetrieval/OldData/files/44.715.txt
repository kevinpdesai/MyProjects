Quality RDT is a valuable complement to microscopy because it helps expand the coverage of parasite-based diagnosis to the periphery and minimize exclusively clinical diagnosis. The cost of improved malaria diagnosis will inevitably increase, whether by investment in microscopy or RDTs or both. However, such investment offers a more promising strategy to deal with increasing costs of therapy driven by drug resistance. Today’s multi-million dollar investment in anti-malarial drug development should be accompanied by a parallel commitment to improve diagnostic tools and their availability to those living in malarious areas
