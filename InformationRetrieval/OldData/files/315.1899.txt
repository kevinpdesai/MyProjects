Malaria is a serious illness that can get worse very quickly and can be fatal if not treated promptly.
It can also cause serious complications including:
severe anaemia: where red blood cells are unable to carry enough oxygen around the body, leading to drowsiness and weakness
cerebral malaria: in rare cases, the small blood vessels leading to the brain can become blocked, causing seizures, brain damage and coma
