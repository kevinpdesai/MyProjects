What are the symptoms of epidemic typhus fever?
Common symptoms include high fever, headache, chills, tiredness and muscle aches. About half of
people who are infected develop a flat red rash that begins on the back, chest and stomach and then
spreads to the rest of the body except for the face, palms and soles. Other symptoms may include
vomiting, eye sensitivity to light, and confusion. In severe cases, complications of illness may include
kidney failure and brain inflammation (encephalitis).
