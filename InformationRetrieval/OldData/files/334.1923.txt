The clinical manifestations of murine typhus are similar to those of epidemic typhus, although the former is usually less severe. The incubation period is usually more prolonged than that of epidemic typhus. Prodromal symptoms include headache, arthralgia and ill feeling, with or without a low grade fever. Onset is characterized by persistent headache, a high grade fever, and a cutaneous rash predominating on the trunk. The rash is usually less apparent than in epidemic typhus, and occasionally absent. Complications remain rare in murine typhus which is considered a benign disease since complete recovery occurs spontaneously in almost all cases.
