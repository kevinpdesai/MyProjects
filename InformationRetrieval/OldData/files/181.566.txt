With a few citizens of the United States becoming infected with Ebola, state health officials are beginning to take a highly precautious stance and are enforcing unnecessary laws. Some governors in the United States have instituted a mandatory 21-day quarantine law for healthcare workers returning from Ebola-affected regions. The aim of this rather conservative quarantine law is to provide protection and maintain health for the people in the States. However, I’d argue that it has more negative consequences on health issues than positive. The very reasons for the institution of the quarantine law aren’t based on scientific evidence. Consequently, this law doesn’t resonate well with health care workers as they return from combatting an infectious disease and find out that they will be unpaid for three weeks and have to take a leave of absence from their everyday lives and medical careers. In addition, a prestigious health conference in New Orleans banned any participants who had been in Ebola- affected areas 21-days prior to the conference. Because these laws contradict scientific evidence on the contagious elements of Ebola, these unnecessary laws will inhibit and dissuade American health care workers to want to travel to Ebola-affected regions such as Sierra-Leone and Liberia and in return, it will further limit the amount of American resources available to combat the Ebola outbreak.
