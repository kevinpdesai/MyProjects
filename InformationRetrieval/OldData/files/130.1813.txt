Typhus is an infectious disease caused by bacteria in the genus Rickettsia. There are several different types of typhus infection. Endemic typhus, also called murine typhus or “jail fever,” is transfered from rodents to humans from bites from ticks, fleas or lice. The causative agent is Rickettsia typhi. Endemic typhus is a less severe infection than epidemic typhus, which is caused by a bacterium called Rickettsia prowazekii that is carried by fleas and lice of flying squirrels. Even without treatment, the mortality rate for endemic typhus is around 2 percent. The mortality rate for untreated epidemic typhus, however, is 10 to 60 percent. Fortunately, both types of typhus infection are readily treated with antibiotics and almost all people who receive antibiotic treatment in time recover completely. The people who are most at risk for serious complications and fatal typhus infections are elderly individuals.
