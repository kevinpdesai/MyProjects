 The fifth virus, Reston virus (RESTV) (Reston ebolavirus), has caused disease in nonhuman primates such as monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees but is not thought to cause disease in humans. A host of similar species are probably associated with Reston virus, which was isolated from infected cynomolgous monkeys that were imported to the United States and Italy from the Philippines. Several workers in the Philippines and in US holding facilities became infected with the virus, but did not become ill.
