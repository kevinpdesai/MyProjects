When and how did the Ebola outbreak start?
It’s believed that the first case was a 2-year-old boy in a small village in Guinea who died in early December 2013. His family was also infected. The disease began to spread to neighboring Sierra Leone and Liberia, though officials did not recognize the outbreak as Ebola until March 2014.
