Epidemic typhus is caused by the bacteria Rickettsia prowazekii and is transmitted by head and body lice in the genus Pediculus. These lice are a natural parasite of humans and are passed from person to person. They thrive in areas with poor sanitation or where personal hygiene is lacking. Epidemic typhus is the most deadly, history-changing form of typhus. This is the scourge that ravaged the Aztecs and the soldiers in many historic wars.
