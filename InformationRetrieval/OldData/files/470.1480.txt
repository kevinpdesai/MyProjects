Refugees arriving from Southeast Asia, South Asia, Central Asia, and all areas in the Western Hemisphere generally come from areas with low or absent levels of malaria transmission. In contrast to the situation among refugees from sub-Saharan Africa it is rare for persons from these areas to have asymptomatic or sub-clinical P. falciparum malaria infection. In these refugee populations, the risk and cost of post-arrival presumptive treatment currently outweighs the potential benefits. Furthermore, laboratory screening, especially given the issues with sensitivity, specificity and availability of the testing, is not indicated. Therefore, currently, CDC does not recommend presumptive treatment or routine laboratory screening for malaria in refugees from areas other than sub-Saharan Africa. However, any refugee from an endemic area with signs or symptoms of malaria should be receiving diagnostic testing for Plasmodium and subsequent treatment for confirmed infections.
