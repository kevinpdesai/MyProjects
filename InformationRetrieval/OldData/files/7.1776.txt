The course of untreated typhoid fever is classically divided into four stages, each lasting about a week. This disease pattern is not commonly seen, with severe disease representing the 'tip of the iceberg' in typhoid, and with the advent of antibiotics altering the course of the disease. For descriptions of the untreated disease the literature relies on historical descriptive accounts by physicians such as Sir William Osler.Week oneGradual rise in temperature, typically worse through the day, over the first 2-3 days, typically reaches 40°C (104°F).Dry cough.Relative bradycardia (Faget's sign): - the pulse is slower than would be expected from the degree of temperature.Malaise.Headache.Epistaxis in around a third.Abdominal pain.Leukopenia with relative lymphocytosis.Blood cultures are positive for S. typhi (or S. paratyphi).Widal's test is usually negative.In this bacteraemic phase it is possible to find bacteria in the reticuloendothelial tissues of the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and gallbladder and Peyer's patches in the terminal ileum. The gallbladder is infected via the liver and infected bile gives positive stool cultures and re-infects the bowel. Gallstones predispose to chronic biliary infection and long-term faecal carriage.Week twoDuring the second week the patient has a toxic appearance with apathy and sustained pyrexia.High fever around 40°C (104°F), often swinging.Malaise and weakness.Relative bradycardia, with dicrotic pulse wave.Confusional state, which gave typhoid the name of 'nervous fever'.Rose spots on the lower chest and abdomen - seen in around one third of Caucasian patients; difficult to see in darker skin. Rose spots are caused by bacterial emboli. They are crops of macules 2-4 mm in diameter that blanch on pressure.Lung base rhonchi.Abdominal distension with right lower quadrant tenderness and increased borborygmi.Diarrhoea, typically green, with a characteristic foul smell, often compared to pea soup.Constipation may also occur.Hepatosplenomegaly is common.Elevated liver transaminases.Positive Widal's test.Week threeBy the third week there is considerable weight loss.Pyrexia persists and a toxic confusional state may occur.Marked abdominal distension develops and liquid, foul, green-yellow diarrhoea is common.The patient is weak with a weak pulse and raised respiratory rate.Crackles may develop over the lung bases.Death can occur at this stage from overwhelming toxaemia, myocarditis, intestinal haemorrhage, or perforation of the gut, usually at Peyer's patches.Complications which are most likely to develop at this stage include:Intestinal haemorrhage due to bleeding from congested Peyer's patches.Perforation of the distal ileum, frequently fatal. There may be little warning, and peritonitis is a common complication.Encephalitis.Neuropsychiatric symptoms: muttering, picking at clothes, confusion.Metastatic abscesses.Cholecystitis.Endocarditis.Osteitis.Dehydration is a significant risk.One third develop a macular truncal rash.Thrombocytopenia with risk of bleeding.Eye complications may occur (usually only with associated systemic illness) including corneal ulcers, uveitis, abscesses (eyelid or orbit), vitreous or retinal haemorrhage, retinal detachment, optic neuritis, extraocular muscle palsies, and orbital thromboses.
