Primaquine is an antimalarial drug which does not cure malaria illness, but is known to kill the gametocyte stage of the malaria parasite which infects mosquitoes when they bite humans. Primaquine is also known to have potentially serious side effects in people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, an enzyme deficiency common in many malaria endemic settings. In these people, high doses of primaquine given over several days damages red blood cells and causes anaemia, and sometimes these events may be life-threatening.
