Cholera vaccine is a heat-killed suspension of the Inaba and Ogawa serotypes of V. cholerae O1. It provides partial protection (approximately 50%) for three to six months. It is not routinely recommended and advice to overseas travellers should emphasise careful selection of food and water rather than immunisation. Officially, cholera vaccination certificates are no longer required by any country or territory. Unofficially, some countries may still require such a certificate, in which case a single dose of cholera vaccine would satisfy this requirement.
