We identified ninety-three documents containing 179 statements of the incubation period of cholera (Fig. 1). Of these, 35% (63/179) came from original studies, 25% (45/179) cited a source, and 40% (71/179) gave no source. Statements of the incubation period pertained to the mean, the range of the mean, the median, the range of the full incubation period, and to non-specific measures of the range or central tendency. The majority of published estimates of cholera’s incubation period are consistent with a duration of 1–5 days with a mode of 3 days. In most cases, no serogroup, serotype or biotype was specified in these statements.
