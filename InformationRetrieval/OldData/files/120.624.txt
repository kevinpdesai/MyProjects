The goal of interrupting chains of Ebola virus transmission depends heavily on laboratory support. This support is needed to confirm or discard suspected cases, guide triage and clinical decisions, aid contact tracing, and facilitate the early detection of cases in people with an exposure history. The WHO goal of aggressive case detection and isolation likewise depends on laboratory support.
