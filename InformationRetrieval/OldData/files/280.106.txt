Emergence of the Virus - Nzara and Maridi, South Sudan, 1976
The first case of Ebola-Sudan (EBO-S) was first detected in Nzara, Sudan and then spread to Maridi, Tembura, and Juba. On June 27, 1976, a Nzara Cotton Manufacturing Factory cloth room worker, YuG, became ill with a hemorrhagic febrile disease, Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF), and died in the Nzara hospital on July 6, 1976. The second primary case of EHF was a man, Bz, who also worked in the cloth room and died in the hospital on July 14. Bz's wife, who nursed him during his illness, suffered a fatal case of Ebola hemorrhagic fever. The epidemiologically most important primary case, PG, who worked alongside YuG and Bz, became ill on July 18 and died on July 27 after several short stays in the Nzara hospital. 69% of all the EHF cases in Nzara and the introduction to Maridi and Tembura were traced to PG. The World Health Organisation (WHO) investigators reported observing direct person-to-person transmission of EBO-S through six generations of EHF cases traced back to PG.
