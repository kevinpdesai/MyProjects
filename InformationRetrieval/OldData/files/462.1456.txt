While this represents significant progress, we can’t stop now. Too many times in the past, we’ve succeeded in reducing malaria cases, but did not keep up the fight. The malaria parasite evolves, and resistance is developing to both the drugs and the insecticides used to treat the bed nets. We need to continue to invest in the development of new ways to prevent and treat malaria.
Just think how many more lives we can save by keeping up the effort that so many people have diligently contributed to already. We need to make sure that all children and parents sleep under bed nets at night, and have access to appropriate diagnosis and treatment if they do get sick from malaria. This will require continued leadership and funding from both countries where malaria is present and countries where it isn’t, but where people care about saving lives.
