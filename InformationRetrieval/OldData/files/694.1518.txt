The virus is known to live in fruit bats, and normally affects people living in or near tropical rainforests. It is introduced into the human population through close contact with the sweat, blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as fruit bats, chimpanzees, forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead or in the rainforest.
