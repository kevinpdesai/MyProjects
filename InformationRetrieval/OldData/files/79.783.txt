Early in August, when doctors worried that a patient at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York had Ebola, it took nearly three days to confirm that he didn't. And that was in one of the richest, most medically advanced cities in the world.
In Sierra Leone and neighboring Liberia, local hospitals have closed because no one can tell the difference between early Ebola and other common ailments. This means no one is getting care for other illnesses like malaria and the even deadlier Lassa fever, multiplying the misery there.
