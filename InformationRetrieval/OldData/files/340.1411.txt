“While the 21 day quarantine value currently used may have arose from reasonable interpretation of early outbreak data, this work suggests a reconsideration is in order,” Charles N. Haas wrote in “On the Quarantine Period for Ebola Virus, “and that 21 days may not be sufficiently protective to public health.” Haas looked at incubation times for the virus in previous outbreaks in Congo, Zaire and Uganda. He found that “12% of the time, an individual case will have a greater incubation time than 21 days” — and said some models indicated a 31-day quarantine might be in order. Indeed, data examined in the New England Journal of Medicine shows incubation times even longer than that.
