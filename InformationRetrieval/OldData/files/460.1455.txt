There are a number of sensible precautions that you can take to keep mosquitoes (and other unhelpful bugs) at bay when you're traveling.The following sections provide several methods aimed at reducing your risk provided you are consistent, assiduous, and careful at all times. Note that a number of these measures will also decrease the risks of being bitten, burrowed into, chewed on, etc. by other bugs but you should still take appropriate precautions targeted at any particular danger you're aware of. In a nutshell, specialist in travel medicine, Dr Charlie Easmon, recommends that a traveler use the A, B, C, and D prevention method:[13]
A – for awareness. As already stated, being aware of the risk is your first line of defense.
B – for bite avoidance. Not getting bitten should be your number one aim.
C – for chemoprophylaxis. This means taking preventive methods when traveling into a malarious region.
D – for diagnosis. If you are unfortunate enough to contract malaria, prompt attention and treatment of it is essential.
E – for remote travel. Dr Easmon adds this because if you're traveling somewhere remote, you'll need to know how to use emergency treatment with safe drugs. Talk to your doctor; at this level you should at least be proficient with first aid and have a basic understanding of responding to symptoms etc.
