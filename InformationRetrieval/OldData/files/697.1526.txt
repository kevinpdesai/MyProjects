Malaria is an infectious disease caused by a parasite that is transmitted through
bite of an infected mosquito at night. There are two main types of malaria:
Falciparum and Vivax. Falciparum malaria is the more severe type and can be
fatal. Vivax malaria is generally mild but can sometimes be fatal.
