Cholera is an acute secretory diarrheal illness caused by toxin producing strains of the gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Severe cholera is characterized by profound fluid and electrolyte losses in the stool and the rapid development of hypovolemic shock, often within 24 hours from the initial onset of vomiting and diarrhea. Administration of appropriate rehydration therapy reduces the mortality of severe cholera from over 10 percent to less than 0.5 percent
