The onset of epidemic typhus is often sudden and can include fever, headache, chills and
malaise. In approximately 50% of cases, a rash develops after 5 to 6 days. Small pink
macules usually appear first on the upper trunk or axillae then spread to the entire body
with the exception of the face, palms and soles. As the disease progresses, the rash
usually becomes dark and maculopapular or, in severe cases, petechial and hemorrhagic.
Splenomegaly, hypotension, nausea, vomiting and confusion may also be seen. The fever
lasts approximately 2 weeks. The case-fatality rate increases with age and varies from
10% to 40% in the absence of specific treatment. Children and people with partial
immunity can have a mild infection with no rash.
