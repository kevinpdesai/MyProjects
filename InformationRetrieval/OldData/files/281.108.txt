Biomedical science first encountered the virus family Filoviridae when Marburg virus appeared in 1967 [4]. At that time, commercial laboratory workers with a severe and unusual disease were admitted to a hospital in Marburg, Germany. The attending physician recognized the distinctive clinical picture as additional cases appeared, and an investigation led to the isolation and identification of the immediate source of the virus as green monkeys imported from Africa for use in research and vaccine production.
