The development of a vaccine containing live cholera involves reducing the bacteria’s virulence and ability to cause diarrhea while preserving its ability to induce an immune response. One candidate, Peru-15, developed by NIAID-funded researchers in the Harvard University laboratory of investigator John Mekalanos, Ph.D., has shown promise and is awaiting commercial sponsorship for final development and licensure. A second candidate, CVD-103HgR, was licensed in Europe, but is not currently in production or slated for use in cholera-endemic regions.
