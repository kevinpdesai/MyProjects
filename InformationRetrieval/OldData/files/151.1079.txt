Healthcare workers and responders involved with cases related to Ebola in the United States may be required to work extended, rotating, consecutive, or otherwise unusual shifts. They also need enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) when working with Ebola patients or in Ebola-contaminated areas. These conditions increase the risk of injuries and accidents and can contribute to poor health and worker fatigue.
