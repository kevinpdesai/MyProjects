Cholera is caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. These bacteria release a toxin that causes an increased amount of water to be released from cells that line the intestines. The increase in water produces severe diarrhea.
People get the infection from eating or drinking food or water containing the cholera germ. Living in or traveling to areas where there is cholera raises the risk of getting it.
Cholera occurs in places with a lack of water treatment or sewage treatment, crowding, war, and famine. Common locations for cholera include:
Africa
Asia
India
Mexico
South and Central America
