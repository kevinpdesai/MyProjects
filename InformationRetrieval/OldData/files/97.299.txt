The disease emerged in the 19th century, when it spread across the world from its origin in the Ganges delta in India. Millions have been killed in six subsequent pandemics and the seventh, still present today, started in South Asia in 1961 and reached Africa in 1971. According to the World Health Organization, the number of cholera cases continues to rise, with outbreaks occurring in 56 countries in 2008 alone. In October 2010, a cholera outbreak struck the earthquake-shattered country of Haiti for the first time in at least a century, infecting hundreds of thousands and creating an immediate need for cholera treatment centers, prevention campaigns, and training for Haitian medical professionals, which International Medical Corps is working to provide.
