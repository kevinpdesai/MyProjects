Preventing malaria is definitely better than suffering through it and then going through the malaria recovery phase. Preventive measures include avoiding areas that have been recently populated with mosquitoes. Using bed-nets, insecticides and antibacterial drugs may also be an effective way of avoiding being infected by malaria disease. Children under the age of 5 have the highest number of malaria cases that result in death. Therefore, children should be watched carefully and kept away from areas that may have a heavy populace of mosquitoes.
