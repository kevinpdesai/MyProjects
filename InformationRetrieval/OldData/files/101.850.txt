Scientists believe Ebola spreads through zoonotic transmission- that is, coming from an animal. The first patient of an Ebola outbreak is thought to be infected through contact with an infected animal. From there, the virus can spread to other humans through direct contact with blood or body fluids. Outbreaks often occur in healthcare settings (known as nosocomial transmission), as patients seek treatment in facilities where appropriate infection-control may not be practiced. The symptoms of Ebola are somewhat nonspecific at first. Within 2-21 days of exposure, patients usually experience fever, headache, joint and muscle aches, sore throat, and weakness, later followed by diarrhea, vomiting and stomach pain. Some patients also experience rash, red eyes, hiccups and bleeding. From the onset of symptoms, Ebola can kill a patient within a matter of days.
