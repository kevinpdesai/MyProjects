Epidemic typhus fever occurs most commonly among people living in overcrowded unhygienic
conditions, such as refugee camps or prisons. The disease also occurs in people living in the cool
mountainous regions of Asia, Africa, and Central and South America. In the eastern U.S., occasional
cases of epidemic typhus fever have been reported among people exposed to flying squirrels and/or
their nests.
