Despite concerns regarding dental staining after use of a tetracycline-class antimicrobial agent in children
8 years of age or younger, doxycycline provides superior therapy for this potentially life-threatening
disease. In people who are intolerant of tetracyclines, intravenous chloramphenicol or fluoroquinolones
can be considered. Fluoroquinolones are not recommended for people younger than 18 years of age.
When faced with a seriously ill patient with possible typhus, suitable therapy should be started without
waiting for laboratory confirmation.
