Your doctor will order a blood test to check for the malaria parasite in your blood.
Medicines usually can treat the illness. But some malaria parasites may survive because they are in your liver or they are resistant to the medicine.
Get medical help right away if you have been in an area where malaria is present, were exposed to mosquitoes, and get symptoms that are like the flu. These include a high fever, chills, and muscle pain.
