To answer that we will turn to Dr. Tim Lahey, M.D. (an infectious disease specialist and professor of medicine as well as microbiology and immunology with Dartmouth’s Geisel School of Medicine. When asked how long it would take someone to clinically recover from the Ebola virus, Dr. Lahey stated that you could expect a few week recovery time. It generally takes one to two weeks for symptoms of the disease to appear, on average, and from that point death generally occurs within a couple of weeks. If you are lucky enough to survive, after this few week period you could be considered as recovered.
