Get a prescription for malaria pills. Talk to your doctor about where exactly you are traveling so that he or she can provide a prescription for medication most effective against malaria in the place where you're traveling. The type of medicine differs according to where in the world you're going to be exposed to malaria, so it's important to go over each and every place you'll be.[2]
There is no vaccine for malaria. Instead, your doctor will prescribe the same type of medicine that is used to treat malaria, and you'll take it the entire time you're at risk of exposure.
Make sure to discuss your other medications and health conditions that could affect which prescription you're given. For example, some malaria medicines shouldn't be taken while you're pregnant, and others shouldn't be used by people with certain psychiatric conditions.
In addition to getting the medicine you need to prevent malaria, your doctor or travel clinic attendant should check whether there are any other diseases you will be at risk of contracting.
