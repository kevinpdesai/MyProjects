There is no known treatment for Ebola in humans. Doctors can offer supportive therapy, such as hydration, oxygen and treatment of complicating infections, but mortality rates are still very high. Because the natural reservoir and origin of transmission remains unknown, there are no established methods of primary prevention. Instead, prevention efforts focus on outbreak control in healthcare settings.
There have been 28 documented outbreaks, with 2,288 human cases and 1,331 deaths. The most recent Ebola outbreak, according to the CDC, was a single case in Luwero district, Uganda in May 2011.
