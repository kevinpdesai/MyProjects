Non-falciparum malaria (caused by P. ovale, P. vivax and P. malariae) is rarely associated with severe illness or death. Two species, P. ovale and P. vivax may form a parasite life stage (hypnozoite) that lies dormant in the liver for months to years before emerging to cause blood stage infection and subsequent clinical disease. Primaquine is the only FDA-approved medication in the United States to treat hypnozoites, and must be administered for 14 days. Furthermore, prior to the use of primaquine, additional testing for glucose-6-phosphate dehydogenase (G6PD) enzyme level is necessary because of the potential risk of life-threatening hemolytic anemia in G6PD deficient individuals thus making presumptive therapy more complicated. There are many variants of P. vivax; depending on the sub-type and the geographic location, and 14 days of primaquine dosed at 15 mg/day may cure only 20%-80% of hypnozoite infections at the traditional dosing. However, a higher dosage (30 mg/day) has recently been recommended for better efficacy in both radical cure and presumptive anti-relapse therapy when appropriate. Laboratory testing by blood film and rapid testing has even lower sensitivity than for P. falciparum malaria and is of no value in screening asymptomatic individuals.
