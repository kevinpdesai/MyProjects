Eat food that's completely cooked and hot and avoid street vendor food, if possible. If you do buy a meal from a street vendor, make sure it's cooked in your presence and served hot.
Avoid sushi, as well as raw or improperly cooked fish and seafood of any kind.
Stick to fruits and vegetables that you can peel yourself, such as bananas, oranges and avocados. Stay away from salads and fruits that can't be peeled, such as grapes and berries.
Be wary of dairy foods, including ice cream, which is often contaminated, and unpasteurized milk.
