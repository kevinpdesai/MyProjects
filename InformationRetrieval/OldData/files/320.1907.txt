Cholera patients are routinely treated with a 1–3 day course of effective antibiotics [19,20] along with rehydration therapy, to shorten illness and reduce both rapid water loss [19,21] and the period of V. choleare excretion. However, antimicrobial agents often inhibit sensitive population causing shift in the intestinal microbial populations, with a decrease in anaerobic bacteria and a concomitant increase in aerobic bacteria [22,23]. Likewise, the relative abundance of four strictly anaerobic bacteria namely Bacteroides, Clostridium, Faecalibacterium, and Bifidobacterium, which were found in the gut of six children during acute cholera in the present study, reduced significantly during the period of antibiotic therapy (data not shown). Antibiotics namely, cephalosporins and some penicillins were shown to affect the gut microbiota and facilitate colonization of the gut by Enterococcus especially the ones that are resistant to vancomycin [24]. Although the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of gut microbiota was not determined in the present study, an increase of the Enterococcus was evident during antibiotic receiving period when E. coli flourished rapidly and became the most abundant bacteria, suggesting the role of antibiotic in facilitating the resistant lineages of E. coli to selectively colonize the gut, as shown recently in pigs fed with performance-enhancing antibiotics [25]. The other possibility of this sudden increase of E. coli and Enterococcus at day 2 might be that the total bacterial number in the gut, including these two groups of bacteria, decreased during administration of antibiotics, but the abundance of E. coli and Enterococcus increased relatively because they were either less or not susceptible to those antibiotics than other gut bacteria.
