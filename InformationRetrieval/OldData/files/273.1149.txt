V. cholerae is a highly motile, halophilic (requires NaCl for growth), curved, gram-negative rod. It is a facultative pathogen that thrives in brackish aquatic environments, which serve as reservoirs for human infection (see 'Epidemiology' below). While in aquatic environments, V. cholerae may enter a viable but non-culturable form [2]. However, V. cholerae is readily grown from clinical specimens, including stool and rectal swabs, and can be identified in microbiology laboratories using selective media and biochemical tests
