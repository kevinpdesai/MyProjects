We are making every effort to ensure that U.S. personnel on the ground are working in an environment where their personal safety and security are protected. Deployed U.S. personnel contracting Ebola would be treated in the most effective manner possible, including evacuation to the U.S.  We are confident that this is a risk we can manage through protective measures in the field as well as screening measures both overseas and here at home.
