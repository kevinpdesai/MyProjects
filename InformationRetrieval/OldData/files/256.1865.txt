Mild cases of cholera usually recover on their own.
Classic cholera has a high mortality rate if it's not treated. In developing countries, mortality among those admitted to hospital without treatment is 60 per cent.
If the illness is treated quickly and properly, the mortality rate is below 1 per cent and the patient recovers completely.
