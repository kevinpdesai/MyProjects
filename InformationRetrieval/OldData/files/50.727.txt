V. cholerae is excreted in the feces and vomitus. Viable organisms can be found
in feces for up to 50 days, on glass for up to a month, on coins for a week, in soil or
dust for up to 16 days and on fingertips for 1 to 2 hours. Bacteria survive well in
water and may remain viable in shellfish, algae or plankton in coastal regions.
