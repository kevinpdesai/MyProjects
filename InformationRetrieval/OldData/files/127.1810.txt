Anyone who has been in a high-risk region within the previous 5 days and develops severe vomiting and diarrhoea should seek urgent medical assessment.
Although cholera can be life-threatening, it is easily treated by immediate rehydration, that is, replacement of the fluid and salts lost through diarrhoea.
Oral rehydration fluid is recommended. This can be obtained from pharmacies.
