Health-care workers treating people with Ebola are at greatest risk of infection.[ 42] The risk increases when they do not have appropriate protective clothing such as masks, gowns, gloves and eye protection; do not wear it properly; or handle contaminated clothing incorrectly.[ 42] This risk is particularly common in parts of Africa where the disease mostly occurs and health systems function poorly.[ 48] There has been transmission in hospitals in some African countries that reuse hypodermic needles.[ 49] [ 50] Some health-care centers caring for people with the disease do not have running water.[ 51] In the United States the spread to two medical workers treating infected patients prompted criticism of inadequate training and procedures.[ 52]
