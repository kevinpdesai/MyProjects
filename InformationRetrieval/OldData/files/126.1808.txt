How long can an infected person carry cholera?
Usually up to a few days after recovery; however, some people may carry it for several months.
What is the treatment for cholera?
Since severe diarrhea may cause rapid dehydration, replacement of fluids is critical. Antibiotics, such as tetracycline, are also used to shorten the duration of diarrhea and the shedding of cholera in stool. A vaccine is available and is sometimes recommended for travelers to certain foreign countries where cholera is occurring. However, the vaccine offers only partial protection (50%) for a short duration (2 to 6 months).
