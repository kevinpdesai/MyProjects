Avoid areas where there is a known typhus outbreak. It is less common in the United States, with only 15 reported cases of epidemic typhus on record. Africa, Central America and China have been known to host populations of epidemic typhus. Endemic typhus can occur anywhere, but especially in tropical and warm-weather locations. Scrub typhus can be found in Australia, the West Pacific and Malaysia. These locations need not be avoided all the time, but heeding warnings of area breakouts is always a good idea.Avoid overcrowded living conditions. Because typhus is transmitted by insects that are difficult to control such as lice, mites and fleas, the disease has the ability to spread with extreme swiftness. Areas of the world that are overpopulated tend to have outbreaks of typhus. Although this is not the only factor that leads to an outbreak, it does do a fair amount to promote a quick circulation of the disease
