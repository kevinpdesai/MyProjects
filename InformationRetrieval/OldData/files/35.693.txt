Genekam Biotechnology AG manufactures a number of kits for zoonostic pathogens. Ebola virus is one of them as it causes infections in human and primates, but its intermediate hosts are bats and pigs. The pigs can pose a real threat to spread this virus to other parts of the worlds. There are 4 different strains of this virus circulating in the world. At present, the aggessive strain has broken out in Africa. Ebola virus causes coagulation irregularities leading to red spots on body parts. It causes depletion of T-lymphocytes too. We have made a small video about the Ebola virus, which will be put on our website shortly.
