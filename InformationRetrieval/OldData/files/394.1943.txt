The prognosis of the Ebola virus disease is poor with about 70% of cases resulting in death. The rare survivors may recover quickly and completely, while some persons may have prolonged recovery with body pains, inflammations, joint pains, skin peeling, hair loss and even sensory changes. Some survivors have also reported excess tearing, eye sensitivity, eye inflammation and blindness. More number of deaths are reported due to low blood pressure and shock rather than blood loss.
