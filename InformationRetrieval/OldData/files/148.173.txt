Clinical symptoms of profuse watery diarrhea. Cholera cots, cots with openings to allow fecal output into a bucket, are used to measure volumes of stool loss and fluid replacement needs. Consider the diagnosis in all cases of severe watery diarrhea and vomiting especially with rapid dehydration and recent travel or consumption of shellfish. Lab tests include stool gram stain (gram negative rods) culture, dark field microscopy or stool PCR.
