An Ebola test that can diagnose the virus in just 15 minutes could soon be shipped out to West Africa, where the disease has killed more than 4,500 people.Current tests can only be conducted in laboratories with specialist equipment, taking up to two-and-a-half hours each, but a pregnancy test-sized kit developed by French scientists could dramatically speed up the process.
France’s Alternative and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) said “Ebola eZYSCREEN” is designed to be used in the field, using only a drop of the patient’s blood, plasma or urine. A prototype will be available to start clinical trials in West Africa by the end of the month.
