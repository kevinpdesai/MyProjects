The basic logic of quarantine is simple—keep sick or potentially sick people isolated to prevent a disease from spreading—and the tactic has been around since at least the Middle Ages. The word itself is derived from the Italian words quaranta giorni, which translate literally as 40 days—in the 14th century, this was the amount of time ships arriving in Venice from infected ports were required to wait at anchor before docking.
