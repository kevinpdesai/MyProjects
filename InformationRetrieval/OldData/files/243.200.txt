Chloramphenicol was the first drug shown to be effective in the treatment of scrub typhus, and is still commonly used in endemic regions. Doses of 250 to 500 mg orally or intravenously every six hours are effective. However, doxycycline (100 mg orally or intravenously twice daily) is now the drug of choice for this illness. Azithromycin has been advocated as an alternative agent in special circumstances.
