The governors of New Jersey and New York announced their quarantine rules on October 24th. Their policy came a day after the news that a New York doctor, Craig Spencer, got Ebola while treating patients in West Africa — and had taken the subway and gone bowling while he was infected with the disease even though he was not contagious. Spencer is now in treatment for Ebola at Bellevue Hospital and is reportedly in serious condition. Illinois, Minnesota, and Georgia followed, announcing mandatory quarantines for travelers exposed to Ebola in West Africa on October 27th. These states are allowing people to wait out the 21 days in the comfort of their homes — with the exception of Georgia, which will put high-risk potential Ebola returnees in a designated facility. Governors appear to be working out the details of these policies on the fly. New Jersey was forced to clarify its rule after a Doctors Without Borders nurse Kaci Hickox went public, even hiring legal aid for what she said was a human rights violation. Instead of confining health workers to a hospital isolation unit, as Kickox was, asymptomatic people who've had direct contact with Ebola will be transported by private vehicles to their homes.
