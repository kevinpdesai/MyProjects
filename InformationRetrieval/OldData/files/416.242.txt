Ozone is extraordinary in terms of its anti-infective and antiviral action, and it has virtually no toxicity, making it a prime candidate for both prevention and treatment of all sorts of infections and viral afflictions.
With bacteria, ozone works by puncturing the membrane of the bacteria, causing it to spill its contents and die. It also inactivates viruses, and does so 10 times faster than chlorine. This is in part why Dr. Rowen is convinced it can be a lifesaving treatment for Ebola patients.
