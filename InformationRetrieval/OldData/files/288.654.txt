Diagnostic confirmation is obtained by microscopic demonstration of malaria parasites on Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood films, which should be examined as soon as possible but within 12 hours of the presentation of any patient with suspected malaria. Institutions unfamiliar with malaria diagnosis should not delay microscopic diagnosis (eg, by sending the films out to a laboratory that cannot provide same-day results), but should promptly refer the patient to a more experienced institution or consult with more experienced personnel at other institutions, their state department of health, or submit digital images captured from stained films directly to the CDC's telediagnosis service (dpdx@cdc.gov, or through the CDC Malaria Hotline or CDC Emergency Operations Center [Malaria Hotline 770-488-7788 Monday-Friday, 8 AM to 4:30 PM. Off-hours, weekends, and federal holidays, CDC clinicians can be reached by calling the CDC Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100 and asking for the malaria clinician on-call to be paged]).
