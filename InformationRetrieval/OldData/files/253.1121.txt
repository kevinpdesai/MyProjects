The Ebola virus does not spread easily from person to person. It is spread through direct contact with infected bodily fluids, not through casual contact. Severely ill patients require intensive supportive care. The current outbreak of Ebola is in West Africa. There have not been any cases of Ebola in Canada and the risk to Ontarians remains low.
