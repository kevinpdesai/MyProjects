Ebola was first identified in 1976 so, yes, it’s been around for a while. There have been isolated, largely rural outbreaks limited to distanced communities. What makes this different, an epidemic, is that it occurs in a larger population in towns which has permitted it to expand regionally. Outbreaks are local, epidemics are regional, pandemics are global. The fear has been that the regional spread would lead to a global set of currences.
