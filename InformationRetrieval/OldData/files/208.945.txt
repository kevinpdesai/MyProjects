The patient receiving dialysis, who was not identified, was the third Ebola patient cared for in the Hospitalâ€™s isolation unit, following surviving missionaries Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, who arrived about a month earlier. The patient arrived at Emory University Hospital on Sept. 9 from Sierra Leone after four days of showing symptoms, according to Franch, who is also an assistant professor of medicine.
