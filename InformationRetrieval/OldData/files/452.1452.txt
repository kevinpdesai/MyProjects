Malaria is an infection caused by the malaria parasite entering the bloodstream. The parasite may gain entry through the bite of an infected mosquito or infected blood transferred by blood transfusion or a contaminated injection needle.
Mosquito sucking blood There are 4 species of malaria parasites:
Plasmodium vivax
Plasmodium falciparum
Plasmodium malariae
Plasmodium ovale
Plasmodium parasites enter the bloodstream usually after a bite from the anopheles mosquito. The parasites pass through the liver. In the case of vivax and ovale they may lie dormant in the liver for months or years accounting for late relapses.Relapses of this nature from the liver do not occur with falciparum or malariae but chronic infection in the blood may persist for a few years. Once released from the liver the parasites invade the red blood cells. A cycle of 48 hours is required for falciparum,vivax and ovale and 72 hours for malariae for division and change.After this time they damage the red blood cell and are liberated. They then invade uninfected red cells and start dividing again thus repeating the cycle.At the time of rupture of the red cell they release substances called pyrogens which cause the symptoms of malaria.
