Wear protective medical clothing if you're around infected patients. While it's best to avoid areas of infection entirely, if you're working in a healthcare or volunteer capacity around infected patients, the use of extreme caution is necessary. When the virus first broke out, the CDC recommended that hospital workers use disposable masks, gloves, goggles, and gowns, which needed to be worn at all times if you're around infected patients; now, the CDC is recommending a Level 3 suit with a protective hood and taped seams for workers around Ebola patients.[5]
