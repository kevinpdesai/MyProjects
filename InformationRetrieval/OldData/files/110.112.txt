“It is not a casual contact-acquired infection,” notes Safdar. Rather, in its later stages, the Ebola virus is passed from person to person via bodily fluids. There is no known Ebola transmission through coughing or sneezing, like with influenza or tuberculosis, he says. The virus can live on surfaces that are soiled with blood or other body fluids, but sterilizing hospital equipment with bleach kills Ebola.
