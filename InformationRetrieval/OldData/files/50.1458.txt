The incubation period is a few hours to 5 days. Most infections become apparent after 2 to 3 days. Cholera appears abruptly with painless, watery diarrhea, sometimes accompanied by vomiting. Infections may be subclinical, mild and self–limiting, or fulminant and severe. Severe fluid loss can be seen in more serious cases; thirst, oliguria, severe dehydration, acidosis, muscle cramps and shock may result. Most cases last approximately 2 to 7 days but death may occur within a few hours if the fluid loss is high. A self–limiting gastroenteritis is seen after infection with pathogenic non O1/O139 strains.
