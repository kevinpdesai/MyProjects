Cholera is caused by a number of types of Vibrio cholerae, with some types producing more severe disease than others. It is spread mostly by water and food that has been contaminated with human feces containing the bacteria.[2] Insufficiently cooked seafood is a common source.[5] Humans are the only animal affected. Risk factors for the disease include poor sanitation, not enough clean drinking water, and poverty. There are concerns that rising sea levels will increase rates of disease. This disease is diagnosed by the discovery of this bacteria in the stool of the test subject.[2] A rapid test is available but is not as accurate.Prevention involves improved sanitation and access to clean water.[3] Cholera vaccines that are given by mouth provides reasonable protection for about six months.
