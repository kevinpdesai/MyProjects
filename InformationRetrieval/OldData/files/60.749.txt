If you have been in an area where malaria occurs, were exposed to mosquitoes, and have flu-like symptoms, but tests do not show the malaria parasite in your blood, the tests should be repeated 3 or 4 times to confirm that you do not have a malaria infection. During treatment, tests are repeated to follow the course of the infection and to check whether the number of parasites is decreasing.
Your age and health condition are important factors in selecting a medicine to prevent or treat malaria. Pregnant women, children, people who are very old, people who have other health problems, and those who did not take medicine to prevent malaria infection require special consideration.
