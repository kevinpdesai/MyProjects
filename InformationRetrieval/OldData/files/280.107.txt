In July 2012, an outbreak of Ebola virus disease was reported in Kagadi in the Kibaale District with a 66% case fatality rate, bringing back memories of the 2000 Uganda Ebola outbreak. Officials urged people not to panic, and a national emergency task force was established. The government, World Health Organisation and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent experts to tackle the outbreak.
