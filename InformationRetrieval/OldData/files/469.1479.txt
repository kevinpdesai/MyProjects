A restriction period was imposed on all visitors to the island who had visited malaria endemic areas over the past 8 weeks (the long end of the average incubation period for malaria). All foreign workers who work on construction projects on the island would also be screened for malaria using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) after the quarantine period.
