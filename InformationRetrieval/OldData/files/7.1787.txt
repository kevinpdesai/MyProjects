General principles for the management of typhoid:[3][4] Rapid diagnosis and institution of appropriate antibiotic treatment.Adequate nutrition - a soft, easily digestible diet should be continued unless the patient has abdominal distension or ileusSupportive - adequate rest, rehydration and correction of electrolyte disturbances.Antipyretic therapy - as required.Hygiene - carers must be meticulous with hand washing and the disposal of faeces and urine.Close attention to hand washing and limitation of close contact with susceptible individuals during the acute phase of infection.Regular follow-up and monitoring for complications and clinical relapse (this may include confirmation of stool clearance in non-endemic areas or in high-risk groups such as food handlers.Antibiotics (see below) - shorten the course, reduce the rate of complications if begun early and reduce mortality.[15]Steroids - have occasionally been used in severe cases. However, they may induce relapse, so are not generally recommended.Surgical - if perforation of the bowel occurs it will require closure. Treatment with antibiotics alone was once favoured but simple closure and drainage are required.Antibiotic treatment of typhoid fever[12][16][17][18][19] Ideal antibiotic treatment is safe and available in short courses of five days, causes resolution of fever within one week, renders blood and stool cultures sterile, and prevents relapse.Azithromycin has been found to meet these criteria better than other drugs, although localised areas of resistance to azithromycin have been reported.Ciprofloxacin was the drug of choice for ten years following the emergence of resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and trimethoprim (multidrug-resistant typhoid). However, over 80% of S. typhi and over 70% of S. paratyphi infections imported to the UK from Asia have reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones.Among fluoroquinolones, which are more effective than cephalosporins, gatifloxacin appears more effective than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for bacteria showing decreased ciprofloxacin sensitivity.Ceftriaxone is a useful second-line drug.Chloramphenicol, despite its toxicity for bone marrow and history of plasmid-mediated resistance, is used in developing countries where the organism is sensitive to it.The antibiotic is appropriately changed once sensitivities are available.
