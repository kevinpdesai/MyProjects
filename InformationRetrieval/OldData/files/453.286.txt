Can Ebola spread through the air?
No. If Ebola spread through the air, many more people would have already been infected in this outbreak. The general public does not need to worry about breathing it in. However, healthcare workers must wear full personal protective equipment when in contact with Ebola patients, including appropriate respiratory protection (a respirator).
