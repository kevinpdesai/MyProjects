This new drug, termed ZMapp, was developed by a biotech firm (Mapp Biopharmaceutical, Inc.). Several years ago, this company and the National Institutes of Health and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency were tasked to develop a treatment for Ebola virus infection. The drug consists of an anti-Ebola antibody that is made up of part mouse and part human antibody. The mouse part of the antibody is produced in mice immunized against Ebola virus.
