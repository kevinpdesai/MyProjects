In contrast, other kinds of malaria are less severe, and so symptoms can persist before the malaria parasite is naturally cleared by the parasite, usually within 1-2 weeks. In extreme cases, this can last much longer; Plasmodium malariae is the slowest replicating form of malaria, and so frequently causes mild infections which can last weeks, if not months. In some cases, people are infected with low levels of P. malariae for years without even experiencing symptoms, since their own immune system is able to keep levels of the parasite low enough so that they don’t cause noticeable disease.
