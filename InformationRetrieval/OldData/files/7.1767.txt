In the UK, an average of almost 500 cases were reported per year between 2006 and 2010. This is a 25% increase on the previous five years. Over half of cases were in London. Between 2007 and 2010, 1,673 surveillance questionnaires were received by the Health Protection Agency. They showed that 73% of affected patients were of Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi ethnicity, that 96% of cases were acquired abroad and that the bulk of travel was to India, Pakistan or Bangladesh. 84% of those who had travelled were visiting friends and relatives. 7% of those who completed questionnaires had no travel history, and for most of these, there was no identifiable source of infection. 40% of non-travel cases were from London.[9]Risk factors
