Patients who test positive for Ebola sometimes test negative after a few days treatment without the use of any experimental drug for Ebola. What kind of treatment did they get, how were they 'cured'? 
There is no cure for Ebola that is approved and widely available. Experimental treatments are still being evaluated to see if they are safe and effective. People with Ebola are treated supportively, which means they receive care that maximizes their body’s own natural ability to survive and recover. These treatments can help a person survive, but do not cure Ebola. They include intravenous fluids, supplemental oxygen, and antibiotics if the person develops a bacterial infection along with their infection.
