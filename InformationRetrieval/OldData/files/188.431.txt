Symptoms of endemic typhus develop within about one to two weeks after initial infection and may include a high fever (about 105 F), headache, malaise, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a rash that begins about four to seven days on the chest and abdomen after the initial symptoms above develop; the rash often spreads. Some patients may also have a cough and abdominal,joint, andback pain. Symptoms may last for about two weeks and, barring complications or death (less than 2% die), symptoms abate.
