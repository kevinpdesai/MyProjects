The latest Ebola occurrence is thought to have started in Uganda's western Kibaale District about three weeks ago, but was confirmed only last Friday.
The outbreak initially went undetected, because patients did not show typical Ebola symptoms, such as hemorrhaging, and because they had other illnesses, such as malaria, which complicated diagnosis, according to Ugandan officials.
