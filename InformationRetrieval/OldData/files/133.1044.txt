The experimental vaccine is based on an animal virus called vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) that is combined with a portion of the protein covering of the Ebola virus. When administered, it induces an immune response against the Ebola virus. It does not contain a live Ebola virus. There is no risk that volunteers could contract the Ebola virus through participation in the trials.
