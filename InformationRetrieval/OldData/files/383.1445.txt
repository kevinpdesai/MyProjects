An incubation period is the time between being infected with a virus and the appearance of symptoms caused by that virus or disease. In the case of Ebola, incubation was normally thought to be between five and ten days. During this recent outbreak, however, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that, “Recent studies conducted in West Africa have demonstrated that 95% of confirmed cases have an incubation period in the range of 2 to 21 days.”
