New York City health officials said yesterday that a patient who was at first asymptomatic then got sick after returning from one of West Africa's Ebola countries on Dec 20 was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center yesterday. In an earlier statement the health department said the patient did not have contact with Ebola patients while in West Africa, but due to the travel history and symptoms, he or she was isolated and evaluated. Test results were negative for Ebola, and the patient's medical team has confirmed an alternative diagnosis. The individual is still hospitalized at the facility in critical condition.
