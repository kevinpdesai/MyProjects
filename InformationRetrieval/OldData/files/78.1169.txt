We believe quarantine at entry could be an important adjunct to any outright ban on travel from the region. It is estimated that roughly 150 people arrive daily in the United States from the affected region. Assuming that number holds, then at full capacity there would be roughly 3,150 people in need of quarantine at any given time. We believe the actual number would be fewer, since this measure would likely deter many of those travelers from coming to the United States.While the cost of quarantine would be high, the cost of each Ebola case is enormous. Not only are the medical costs exorbitant, the negative impact on the general economy is likely to be substantial.
