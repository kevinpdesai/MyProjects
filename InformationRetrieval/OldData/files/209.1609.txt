Instead of feeling afraid and becoming paranoid use common sense: wash your hands, pay attention to those who seem to "have the flu", ask questions about recent travel, to what country, exposure to bushmeat etc. Remember, despite what you may think, African "bushmeat" is illegally sold here in America.
