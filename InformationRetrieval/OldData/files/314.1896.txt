Malaria can be a very serious disease for a pregnant woman and her developing fetus, for people without a spleen, and for young children. Medicine choices are limited for a pregnant woman or a child. Infection with P. falciparum can lead to death for a pregnant woman and her fetus. For these reasons, a pregnant woman should not travel to an area where she could get P. falciparum malaria. Visit the CDC website (www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/index.html) to find out whether malaria is a problem in the country where you will be traveling.
