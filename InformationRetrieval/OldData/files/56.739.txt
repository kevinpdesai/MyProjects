WHO recommends artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria caused by the P. falciparum parasite. By combining two active ingredients with different mechanisms of action, ACTs are the most effective antimalarial medicines available today. WHO currently recommends five ACTs for use against P. falciparum malaria. The choice of ACT should be based on the results of therapeutic efficacy studies against local strains of P. falciparum malaria
