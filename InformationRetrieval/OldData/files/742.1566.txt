How do I protect myself against Ebola?
If you must travel to an area affected by the 2014 Ebola outbreak:
Wash your hands frequently or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Avoid contact with the blood and body fluids (such as urine, feces, saliva, sweat, urine, vomit, breast milk, semen, and vaginal fluids) of any person, particularly someone who is sick.
Do not handle items that may have come in contact with an infected person’s blood or body fluids.
Do not touch the body of someone who has died from Ebola.
