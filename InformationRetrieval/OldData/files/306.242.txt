Between 6 and 22 June 1995, 8 patients (mean age, 33 years; range, 12–54) who met the criteria of the clinical EBO(Ebola) case definition used in Kikwit were transfused with blood donated by convalescent patients. Transfusions were given with patient consent or the consent of a family member if the patient had reduced consciousness.
