Antimicrobial therapy for cholera is an adjunct to fluid therapy and is not an essential therapeutic component. However, an effective antibiotic can reduce the volume of diarrhea in patients with severe cholera and shorten the period during which Vibrio cholerae O1 is excreted. In addition, it usually stops the diarrhea within 48 hours, thus shortening the period of hospitalization. No other drugs besides antibiotics should be used in the treatment of cholera.
