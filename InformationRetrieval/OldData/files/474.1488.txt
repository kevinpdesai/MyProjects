This early 19th century theory for disease provided a way to dissect this illness down further into its subcomponents, making it easier for scientists to get a better idea on the mechanisms involved and thereafter come up with still more new theories for how the disease develops.  When Stille produced his map and displayed the long trails of the disease inferring just human interactions were at stake, the proof that this disease was bacterial in origin was just about to be published.  Stille may have known this.  At the beginning of this section is a photo of a handwritten note that is found on the page inside the cover–“the Code of Marseilles.”This is a description of what the cholera bacterium looked like during in infectious and fatal, and non-infection, non-fatal stages.  The Code of Marseilles (a centuries old code for shipping of people and commodities) was related to the quarantine of commercial ships possibly carrying disease to New York in 1797, when the first Quarantine Act (from quaranti giorni for “40 days” (see one source)) was established by New York physician and congressman Samuel Mitchell (see also this US Government Document for early Post-Roman era history)
