CDC recommends staff members use standard, contact, and droplet precautions to care for a PUI or patient with confirmed EVD.Staff members might need to take additional infection control steps if a PUI or patient with confirmed EVD has other conditions or illnesses, such as tuberculosis, or requires care involving aerosol-generating procedures.Healthcare personnel can be exposed to Ebola virus by touching a patient’s body fluids, contaminated medical supplies and equipment, or contaminated environmental surfaces. Splashes to unprotected mucous membranes (for example, the eyes, nose, or mouth) are particularly hazardous. Procedures that can increase environmental contamination with infectious material or create aerosols should be minimized.
