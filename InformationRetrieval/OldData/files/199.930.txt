"Ebola is a bi-phasic disease. There are several different clinical stages of the illness," Faber explains. The first phase, showing symptoms of fever, headache and sore throat, is soon followed by the G.I. phase when more severe gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea begin. If supportive care begins early, patients have the best chance of pulling through.
