Similar comments were made by Anthony Fauci, Director of the US NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who said that 42 percent of the cases have occurred in the last month and that the outbreak is "completely out of control". He further noted that the rate of infection is exponential: "The number of cases per unit time is dramatically increasing."
