Although there is a vaccine against cholera, the CDC and World Health Organization don't normally recommend it, because it may not protect up to half of the people who receive it and it lasts only a few months. However, you can protect yourself and your family by using only water that has been boiled, water that has been chemically disinfected, or bottled water. Be sure to use the bottled, boiled, or chemically disinfected water for the following purposes:
Drinking
Preparing food or drinks
Making ice
Brushing your teeth
Washing your face and hands
Washing dishes and utensils that you use to eat or prepare food
Washing fruits and vegetables
