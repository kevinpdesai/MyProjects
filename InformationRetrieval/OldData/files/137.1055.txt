One of the most common diseases throughout the world is malaria, and a number of workers abroad are in countries that are currently coping with a rash of cases. While international health insurance is vital to cover any related expenses while outside of your home country, you should also take the proper steps to reduce the risk of exposure and stay safe at all times. Recently, the World Health Organization stressed a continued emphasis on prevention and education to further decrease the likelihood of a malaria outbreak.
