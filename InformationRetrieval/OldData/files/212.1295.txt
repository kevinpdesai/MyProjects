V. cholerae lacks the acid resistance genes found in many other intestinal pathogens and therefore has a high infectious dose. One must ingest over one million microbes in order to contract cholera because many of the bacteria will die in the stomach due to its highly acidic environment. The incubation period is dependent upon how many organisms successfully passed through the stomach into the small intestine where V. cholerae can colonize. Therefore, the incubation period before showing symptoms ranges from a few hours to five days, typically taking two days before causing symptoms. Once in the small intestine, studies show that some of the bacteria use their flagella to swim towards the epithelial cells and adhere in the crypts of the intestine using a toxin-coregulated pilus to keep from being flushed out [8].
