Malaria parasites are transmitted to humans by the bite of anopheline mosquitoes. After injection, the parasites (at this stage known as sporozoites) circulate for only a few minutes in the blood before finding their way into the host's liver cells. Here, they divide rapidly over the next week or so, a single parasite giving rise in that time to around 30 000 daughter parasites (or merozoites). During this period of frenetic division the host remains completely well.
