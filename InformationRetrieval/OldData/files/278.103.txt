Spread of the Virus
Researchers believe that the first human who contracts Ebola gets the virus from an animal. Then the virus can spread from human to human. Spreading usually occurs in the latter stages of the disease.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, has labeled the Ebola virus a Category “A” agent. This means that it could be a great threat to the public health and has the potential to spread rapidly.
