Testing for Ebola virus by RT-PCR should generally be performed for patients who have symptoms consistent with Ebola virus disease and have had an exposure that puts them at risk. In addition, they should be evaluated for other possible febrile diseases including those that are common in areas where the patient traveled or resided (eg, malaria, typhoid, influenza). (See 'Indications for initial testing for Ebola virus infection' below.)
