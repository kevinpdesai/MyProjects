The patient suffered from acute kidney injury, a common complication of Ebola due to the dehydration caused by the sufferersâ€™ frequent vomiting and diarrhea, according to Connor. The hemodialysis machine, used not as a treatment for the virus, but as a life-support mechanism, acted as an artificial kidney to prevent renal failure by filtering out waste that would normally exit the patient through urinating, Connor said.
