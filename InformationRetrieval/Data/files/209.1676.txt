 A Boston physician, Rick Sacra, was airlifted from Liberia to be treated in the United States. He is the third US missionary, working for Serving in Mission (SIM), who had tested positive for the disease. Sacra was being treated in Omaha at the Nebraska Medical Center. The doctor did not get infected while treating Ebola patients, but was exposed to the virus while delivering babies at a hospital in Liberia. On 9 September, it was reported that Sacra had received an experimental therapy (not ZMapp) and it was later announced that he had received a blood transfusion from Kent Brantly, the American physician who had recovered from the disease. It has been theorized that transfusing blood products from former Ebola patients may assist a diseased person's immune system to fight the disease. He survived. A fourth U.S. citizen who contracted the Ebola virus arrived at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta for treatment. The patient was airlifted from Sierra Leone and landed at Dobbins Air Reserve Base. The identity of the patient, a male doctor working for the WHO in Sierra Leone, has not been released. According to doctors at the hospital, he will not be receiving any experimental treatment and will only receive supportive care to boost his immune system. The patient exited the ambulance and was assisted into the hospital while walking on his own.
