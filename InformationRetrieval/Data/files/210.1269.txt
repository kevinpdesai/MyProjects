This depends on the infecting dose ingested - it is typically 10-20 days for S. typhi (but may be as short as three days). During this phase, 10-20% of patients have transient diarrhoea. The incubation period for paratyphoid has previously been reported to be shorter (1-10 days). However, the surveillance data for England, Wales and Northern Ireland 2007-2010 did not show any significant differences between typhoid and paratyphoid in time of onset of symptoms on arrival to the UK.98% of cases had an onset date within 35 days of return from travel.91% had an onset date within 21 days.[9]Presentation of typhoid fever[8][10][11]
