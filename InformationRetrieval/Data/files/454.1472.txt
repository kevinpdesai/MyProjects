At present, the disease is
recognized as having an incubation period of 6 to 16 days, commonly about 12 days. The onset is
more or less sudden, with chills, fever, and severe headache. Between the fourth and seventh days a
macropapular rash appears and becomes generally distributed on the chest and abdomen, later
spreading to the hands, feet, and rarely, to the face.
