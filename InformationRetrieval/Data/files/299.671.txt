Diagnosing cholera early at the onset of an epidemic, at the field level, should allow for a more timely response and a quick containment of the spread. Currently the gold standard to identify the bacteria, Vibrio cholerae, from patient samples relies on lengthy bacterial cultures, an array of biochemical tests, highly-skilled operators and numerous laboratory resources, few of which are available in remote locations. Research to develop more appropriate tools has largely focused on rapid diagnostic tests and attempts to simplify existing technologies, but no tests have undergone appropriate scrutiny to provide the evidence to make fully informed decisions on the efficacy of the tests
