Therefore, given the low prevalence of infection in most areas, the prolonged course of treatment, potential adverse effects of medication, and the lack of useful laboratory screening tools, CDC does not currently recommend that newly arriving refugees receive presumptive treatment for non-falciparum malaria or laboratory diagnostic evaluation on arrival to the United States. CDC will monitor non-falciparum prevalence rates among future arriving refugee populations, and will update this guidance if indicated.
