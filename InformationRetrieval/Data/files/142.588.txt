In 1922, the typhus epidemic reached its peak in Soviet territory with some 25 to 30 million cases in Russia. Although typhus had ravaged Poland with some 4 million cases reported, efforts to stem the spread of disease in that country had largely succeeded by 1921 through the efforts of public health pioneers such as HÃ©lÃ¨ne Sparrow and Rudolf Weigl.[ 15] In Russia, during the civil war between the White and Red armies, typhus killed three million people,[ 16] [ 17] mainly civilians. During World War II, many German POWs after the loss at Stalingrad died of typhus. Typhus epidemics killed those confined to POW camps, ghettos, and Nazi concentration camps who were held in unhygienic conditions. Pictures of typhus victims' mass graves can be seen in footage shot at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.
