The Ebola outbreak in West Africa offers many lessons about promoting prevention and improving preparedness. In a world of radically increased interdependence, international travel, and trade, there is no such thing as a local outbreak anymore. The International Health Regulations provide the mechanism for collective defence against this universal threat, and shared responsibility for this defence. Only 64 of WHOâ€™s 194 Member States have the essential surveillance, laboratory, response, and other capacities in place to fulfil their obligations under the IHR. This is a shocking statistic. Equally disturbing is the fact that clinicians were left empty-handed, with no tools to prevent or treat a deadly and dreaded disease. This tells us that the system of incentives for R&D needs fixing.
