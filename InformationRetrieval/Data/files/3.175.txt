In March 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported a major Ebola outbreak in Guinea, a western African nation.[ 116] Researchers traced the outbreak to a two-year-old child who died December 2013.[ 117] [ 118] The disease then rapidly spread to the neighboring countries of Liberia and Sierra Leone. It is the largest Ebola outbreak ever documented, and the first recorded in the region.[ 116] In a 26 September statement, the WHO said, "The Ebola epidemic ravaging parts of West Africa is the most severe acute public health emergency seen in modern times. Never before in recorded history has a biosafety level four pathogen infected so many people so quickly, over such a broad geographical area, for so long."[ 119] As of 8 April 2015[update], 25,591 suspected cases and 10,602 deaths had been reported;[ 11] [ 120] however, the WHO has said that these numbers may be underestimated.[ 121]
