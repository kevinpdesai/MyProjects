The only cholera vaccine available now gives partial protection for only three to six months—it does not provide long-term protection like other vaccines. For that reason, it is not recommended to prevent or control cholera outbreaks because it may give a false sense of security to those vaccinated and to public health authorities, who may then forgo implementing more effective measures.
There are two oral vaccines with few side effects that are given outside the United States. These vaccines provide 60 to 100 percent protection against major outbreak strains for at least six months.
