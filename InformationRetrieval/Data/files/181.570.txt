In India as a whole, about half of 1.2 billion people have no household toilets, and in many villages, up to two-thirds of the homes do not have toilets. However, access to toilets is gradually increasing. In 2009, 51% of people had access to sanitation facilities in comparison to 2002, when only 40% of people had access. Federal spending on sanitation increased to about three-fold in 2005.  In addition, the government began to award village councils that decreased open defecation in their districts (Biswas, “Is India’s Lack of Toilets a Cultural Problem”).
