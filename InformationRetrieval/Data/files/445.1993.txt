Yellow fever vaccine may cause a slight fever, headache, tiredness, and muscle aches in 2-10% of persons, starting 3-9 days after vaccination. MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) may cause a fever in 5-15% of persons, starting 5-12 days after vaccination, along with a temporary rash in 5% persons. The old typhoid/cholera combination made many persons feel very 'unwell'. Most of the new 'dead' vaccines do not generally cause fevers. The flu vaccine is 'dead' and cannot cause you to develop the flu. If you develop a fever or become unwell after vaccination, call the doctor who gave you the vaccines.
