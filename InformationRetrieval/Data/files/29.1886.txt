The answer to that depends a lot on what type of malaria they have as well as their own immune status, and particularly if they have been infected with malaria before. So, for example, P. falciparum is the most severe and deadly kind of malaria, and without treatment, many people who do not have acquired immunity (from previous infections) are likely to die within just a few days. This is the type of malaria that causes the most deaths, and explains why most of the fatalities occur in young children, who have not had the chance to acquire immunity.
