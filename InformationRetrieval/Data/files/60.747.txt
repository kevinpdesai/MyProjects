Whether the medicine is being used to prevent or to treat malaria.
Your condition (such as your age or whether you are pregnant).
How sick you are from malaria.
Geographic location where you were exposed to malaria.
Whether the malaria parasite may be resistant to certain medicines.
Side effects of the medicine.
