The treatment has not been tested on humans, although it was given on an emergency basis to seven people who fell ill in recent weeks, including two American missionaries who recovered. Of the seven who received the drug, two have died — an elderly Spanish priest and a Liberian doctor. Two other doctors in Liberia and a British nurse are still being treated. But it is impossible to gauge the drug’s impact based on a small sample of people who became infected at different times and received care under differing circumstances.
