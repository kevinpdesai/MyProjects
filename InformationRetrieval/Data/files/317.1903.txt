In large cholera outbreaks, individuals contract cholera primarily through improperly treated sewage or drinking water. Advances in sewer treatment and water purification have precluded such outbreaks in many countries. In smaller outbreaks, the cholera bacterium finds a home in brackish coastal waters, where it may attach to algae or plankton. Individuals acquire the disease when they consume water, shellfish, or other foods contaminated with the organism.
