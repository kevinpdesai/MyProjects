Many cases of malaria can be avoided. An easy way to remember is the ABCD approach to prevention:
Awareness of risk: find out whether you're at risk of getting malaria before travelling.
Bite prevention: avoid mosquito bites by using insect repellent, covering your arms and legs and using an insecticide- treated mosquito net.
Check whether you need to take malaria prevention tablets: if you do, ensure you take the right antimalarial tablets, at the right dose and that you finish the course.
Diagnosis: seek immediate medical advice if you develop malaria-like symptoms, including up to a year after you return from travelling.
