Ebola tends to come and go over time. The viruses are constantly circulating in animals, most likely bats. Every once in a while, the disease spills over into humans, likely when someone handles or eats undercooked or raw meat from a diseased ape, monkey, or bat. An outbreak can then happen for several months. And then, usually, it becomes quiet again.
