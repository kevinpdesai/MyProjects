The CDC didn’t explain why it reduced the standard by more than one degree. Experts said lowering the temperature threshold could help detect Ebola cases earlier in the infection process. But going much lower than 100.4 degrees would stray into the normal range of human temperatures and could end up creating too many false positives.
