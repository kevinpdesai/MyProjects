When the disease is suspected, treat with moderate- to high-dose oral doxycycline or tetracycline 
Scrub typhus is also treated with doxycycline, although chloramphenicol is used in more severe cases. Resistance is becoming widespread in Thailand in particular, where azithromycin remains effective. Azithromycin is also safe in pregnant women and children. With treatment, fatality of scrub typhus falls to less than 2%.
Patients with epidemic typhus may need IV antibiotics and oxygen.
Antibiotics should be initiated as soon as possible, usually before serological confirmation of the diagnosis. Most patients improve dramatically within 48 hours of starting treatment.
Chloramphenicol is also effective but is less commonly used.
Give antibiotics for five days or for 2-4 days after fever has subsided.
An alternative strategy in outbreak situations is to give patients a single 200 mg dose of doxycycline, although there may be a higher risk of relapse with this approach.
In patients with severe, acute disease, management on a high-dependency area with support measures may be needed.
Recrudescent cases of epidemic typhus will usually be cured by a single further course of antibiotics.
