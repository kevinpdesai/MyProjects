 The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses currently recognizes four subspecies of the Ebolavirus: Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV), Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV), Reston ebolavirus (RESTV), and TaÃ¯ Forest ebolavirus (TAFV). The World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) added an additional subspecies of Ebola, the Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BDBV) or Ebola-Bundibugyo, following an outbreak in Uganda in 2007.
