The bacteria can be found in the parasite (flea, louse) and in their feces which is often
deposited near a bite wound. Infection usually occurs when a bite is scratched,
introducing the bacteria into the wound. Bacteria remain infective in dried feces and
dead parasites, so infection may also be contracted by inhaling the bacteria in dust from
contaminated environments
