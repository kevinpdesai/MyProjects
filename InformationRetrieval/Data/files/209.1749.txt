 It is important to remember that vaccines are usually given to individuals before they are exposed to a virus that causes a disease. A vaccine stimulates the immune system to generate antibodies and cellular immunity that can fight off an infection should it occur. Typically, therapeutics are provided to individuals who are already infected with a virus. As can be seen, prevention of EVD is the best route to take while waiting for the development and rigorous testing of vaccines and other therapeutic treatments.
