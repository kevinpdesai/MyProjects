Aside from the human cost, the outbreak has severely eroded the economies of the affected countries. A Financial Times report suggested the economic impact of the outbreak could kill more people than the virus itself. As of 23 September, in the three hardest hit countries, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, only 893 treatment beds were available even though the current need was 2122 beds. The WHO reported that by 25 August more than 216 health-care workers were among the dead, partly due to the lack of equipment and long hours.[ 131] On 23 October, the Malian government confirmed its first case.[ 132] In response, UNMEER, in cooperation with the Logistics Cluster, air-lifted 1,050 kg of personal protective equipment (PPE) and body bags from Monrovia to Mali.[ 133]
