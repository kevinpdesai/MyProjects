In introductory remarks to the meeting on which this report is based, it was noted that the malaria burden is decreasing in several countries, thus raising the demand for malaria surveillance systems. By 2008, 29 countries outside Africa had reached the target of a 50% reduction in malaria in comparison with 2000; the target has also been achieved in at least nine countries in Africa, meeting the 2010 global targets. It is essential that parasitological confirmation of malaria diagnosis be universally accessible and that all febrile cases suspected of being malaria be confirmed by laboratory testing before malaria treatment is given. More effective approaches are also needed for investigating and managing fever that is not due to malaria, to maximize the benefit of parasitological diagnosis in fever management.
