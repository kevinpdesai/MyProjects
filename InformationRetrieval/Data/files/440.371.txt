As the Ebola virus continues to rip through west Africa, with more than 4,000 killed, Britain is sending hospital ship HMS Argus to help combat the deadly disease.
While this rescue mission is not set to arrive for several days, Captain Jim Masters, 86, has told of his experience being sent to fight the first Ebola outbreak in Africa in 1976.
