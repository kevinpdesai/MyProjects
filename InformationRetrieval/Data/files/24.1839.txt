Recommended care includes volume repletion, maintenance of blood pressure (with vasopressors if needed), and maintenance of oxygenation, pain control, nutritional support, and treatment of  secondary bacterial infections and pre-existing comorbidities. Among patients medically evacuated from West Africa with EVD, large volumes of intravenous fluids often have been required to correct dehydration due to diarrhea and vomiting. Some patients may develop profound third-spacing of fluids due to vascular leak. Some organizations have suggested the addition of broad-spectrum antimicrobials, particularly in patients with evidence of septic shock. Infection prevention and control measures are a critical part of clinical management; all bodily fluids and clinical specimens should be considered potentially infectious.
