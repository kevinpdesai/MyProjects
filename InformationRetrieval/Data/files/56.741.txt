Severe malaria should be treated with injectable artesunate (intramuscular or intravenous) and followed by a complete course of an ACT as soon as the patient can take oral medicines. Where injectable treatment cannot be given, patients with severe malaria should immediately receive pre-referral treatment with intra-rectal artesunate and be referred to an appropriate facility for full parenteral treatment.
