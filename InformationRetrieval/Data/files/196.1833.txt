If you’re going to an area where there is malaria, it’s very important that you take precautions to prevent the disease. The key to this is to protect yourself against being bitten by mosquitoes. Antimalarial medicines are also available but it’s important to remember that these aren’t completely effective. Therefore, it’s vital to take steps to prevent yourself from getting bitten. Make sure that you see your GP or a travel health clinic several weeks before you travel.
