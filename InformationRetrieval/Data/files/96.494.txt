Prevention involves improved sanitation and access to clean water.[ 3] Cholera vaccines that are given by mouth provides reasonable protection for about six months. They have the added benefit of protecting against another type of diarrhea caused by E. coli. The primary treatment is oral rehydration therapy, with slightly sweet and salty fluids. Rice based oral rehydration solutions are preferred.[ 2] Zinc supplementation is useful in children.[ 7] In severe cases, intravenous fluids, such as with Ringer's lactate, may be required, and antibiotics may be beneficial. Testing to see what antibiotic the cholera is susceptible to can help guide the choice.[ 1]
