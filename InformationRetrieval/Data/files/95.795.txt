Currently there are medicines available to treat falciparum malaria - the most prevalent form of the disease in Africa - but this requires a 3-day treatment course. Ideally, we need a drug that needs just one administration to ensure that treatment can be directly observed by the healthcare worker. This is especially important when treatment follow-up is difficult, as is the case in many malaria-endemic countries.  MMV is currently trialling a long-sought one-dose cure.
