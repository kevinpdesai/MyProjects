If a patient who is suspected to have EVD comes into the Emergency Department (ED), how
long will they have to stay in the ED? What will happen next?
A. If you have a patient who has traveled from Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone within the
past 21 days AND has signs and symptoms of EVD, you should immediately isolate the
patient, and then contact the ISDH at 844-257-0052
