In brief: It varies a lot
Malaria symptoms show up a week to a few months after being infected by a mosquito bite.
With treatment, the symptoms should go away in a couple of weeks. However, without treatment, and depending on the strain of malaria parasite, an infected person can have symptoms for a few years, up to a few decades. The person develops immunity over time, and his symptoms may decrease as the years go by.
