Travel and health officials check for signs of Ebola – including diarrhea, vomiting and bleeding – before anyone boards a flight from affected countries in West Africa. Symptoms, however, may take up to 21 days after a person has been infected to show up. Because Ebola cannot be tested for during that period, health officials at airports are taking people's temperatures, with 12 people having been stopped so far. Some have had a cold or another illness, and some have had Ebola, Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said during a briefing on Duncan's case Thursday.
