Cholera is a water and food borne disease caused by enteric pathogen Vibrio cholerae. It is most prevalent in underdeveloped countries with poor or no water sanitation techniques. It affects 3-5 million people per year and kills about 100,000 to 120,000 people among those affected. Cholera is only detrimental if left untreated, with the ability to kill an infected person within hours. It has a short incubation period ranging from a couple of hours to 5 days. It works by using an A-B toxin mechanism to invade host cells and replicate. Symptoms include dehydration from diarrhea and vomiting. Onset of cholera can be identified by its distinctive "rice water stool" although some cases may remain asymptomatic. Treatment includes rehydration via oral salts and intravenous hydration in moderate to severe cases. Antibiotics are prescribed for severe cases to prevent the spread of the pathogen [9]. Transmission is due to interaction or ingestion of fecal contaminated waters or seafood that harbors V. cholerae. Preventative measures include adequate hygiene, water sanitation, safe food preparation, and avoiding undercooked seafood. The Sari Filtration technique can be applied to adequately filter water of zooplankton and copepods that carry V. cholerae. The host response allows for immunological memory to protect against reinfection [13].
