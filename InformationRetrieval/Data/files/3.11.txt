No specific treatment or vaccine for the virus is available, although a number of potential treatments are being studied. Supportive efforts, however, improve outcomes. This includes either oral rehydration therapy (drinking slightly sweetened and salty water) or giving intravenous fluids as well as treating symptoms. The disease was first identified in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks, one in Nzara, and the other in Yambuku, a village near theEbola River from which the disease takes its name.[6] EVD outbreaks occur intermittently in tropical regions ofsub-Saharan Africa.[1] Between 1976 and 2013, the World Health Organization reports a total of 24 outbreaks involving 1,716 cases.[1][7] The largest outbreak is the ongoing epidemic in West Africa centered in Guinea,Sierra Leone and Liberia.[8][9][10] As of 8 April 2015, this outbreak has 25,591 reported cases resulting in 10,602 deaths.
