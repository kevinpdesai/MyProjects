In non-endemic countries, patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of typhoid or paratyphoid fever are initially assessed in hospital where a firm diagnosis by blood culture or bone marrow culture can be made, and antibiotic sensitivities determined. Empiric antibiotic treatment is commenced depending on the likely source of the infection (country travelled to). Clinically unstable patients are admitted to hospital for IV treatment while those who are stable may be treated as outpatients.
