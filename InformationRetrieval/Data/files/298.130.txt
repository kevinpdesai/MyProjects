Most Ebola virus outbreaks have originated in Africa and have traveled only to other countries through shipment of non-human primates or through accidental contamination in testing facilities. Crab-eating macque that were imported from the Philippines to Reston, Virginia in 1989 were found to have a virus similar to Ebola. Over 150 animal handlers were all tested for Ebola and only 6 were found to have developed antibodies to it, none of which actually developed Ebola hemorrhagic fever. The Center for Disease Control concluded that this strain had a low infection rate for humans and it was later classified as its own strain named Reston Ebola virus.
