The disease has a high mortality rate: often between 50 percent and 90 percent. April 2014 information from the WHO across all occurrences to date puts the overall fatality rate at 60%-65%. There are indications based on variations in death rate between countries that early and effective treatment of symptoms (e.g., supportive care to prevent dehydration) may reduce the fatality rate significantly.
