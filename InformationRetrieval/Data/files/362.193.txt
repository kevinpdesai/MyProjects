Here is a roundup of some of the Ebola treatments and vaccines in the research pipeline:
NIAID/GSK investigational Ebola vaccine: The first safety tests of this vaccine, developed by scientists at the NIAID and GlaxoSmithKline, began in September in healthy volunteers at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD, and in Great Britain. GSK says it will have 15,000 doses available in December, when field testing in Liberia is expected to begin, Peter Jahrling, PhD, chief scientist at the NIAID Integrated Research Facility, said at an Ebola forum on Oct. 14 at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
