Apart from exposure to the organism, a number of host factors increase the risk of infection with Salmonella spp. by reducing the necessary infectious organism load. These include:Disease-related or iatrogenic achlorhydria (antacids, H2-receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors), reduction in stomach acidity or gut pathology (surgery, inflammatory bowel disease, malignancy) and recent antibiotics increase the susceptibility to infection.Immunosuppression of any cause.Several other infections, notably schistosomiasis, malaria, histoplasmosis and bartonellosis, are associated with an increased risk of infection with Salmonella spp.Typhoid is more common, and more severe at the extremes of age. Neonatal typhoid, usually acquired from the mother, may follow a fulminant course often with meningitis.Patients with haemoglobinopathies, particularly sickle cell disease, are also at increased risk.Incubation period
