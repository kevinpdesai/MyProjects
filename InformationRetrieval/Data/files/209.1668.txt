 December 2013: Researchers believe that a 2-year-old boy was the index case of the current EVD outbreak. He died on 28 December 2013 in the village of Meliandou, GuÃ©ckÃ©dou Prefecture, Guinea. His mother, sister, and grandmother then became ill with similar symptoms. All died. People infected by those victims spread the disease to other villages. Although Ebola represents a major public health issue in sub-Saharan Africa, no cases had ever been reported in West Africa and the early cases were diagnosed as diseases more common to the area. Thus, the disease had several months to spread before it was recognized as Ebola.
