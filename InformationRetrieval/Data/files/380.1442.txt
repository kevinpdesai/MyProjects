After infection with the Ebola virus, there is an incubation period of 2 – 21 days (on average, 8 – 10 days) after which the person will start to experience symptoms. The initial symptoms include fever, weakness and lethargy, muscle pain, headache and sometimes sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and sometimes a rash. Some patients may experience bleeding inside and outside of the body; this is the most serious complication.
