The standard molecular assays currently used in mobile and other laboratories supporting the Ebola response include the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, or RT-PCR test. The test, which involves a number of laborious procedures, provides very accurate results when performed by trained staff. Each test requires a full tube of blood, takes from 2 to 6 hours, and costs around $100. These requirements are difficult to meet in resource-constrained West African settings, thus severely limiting testing capacity.
