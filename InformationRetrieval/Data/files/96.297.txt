Since it became widespread in the 19th century, cholera has killed tens of millions of people.[59] In Russia alone, between 1847 and 1851, more than one million people perished of the disease.[60] It killed 150,000 Americans during the second pandemic.[61] Between 1900 and 1920, perhaps eight million people died of cholera in India.[62] Cholera became the first reportable disease in the United States due to the significant effects it had on health.[11] John Snow, in England, was the first to identify the importance of contaminated water as its cause in 1854.[11] Cholera is now no longer considered a pressing health threat in Europe and North America due to filtering and chlorination of water supplies, but still heavily affects populations in developing countries.
