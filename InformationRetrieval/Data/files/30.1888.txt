Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) describes the administration of a full therapeutic course of an anti-malarial to at risk subjects at specified times regardless of whether they are infected or not. IPT differs from chemoprophylaxis, which aims to sustain blood levels above the mean inhibitory concentration for a prolonged period, in producing protective drug concentrations for only short periods of time separated by periods when drug concentrations are below the level necessary to inhibit parasite growth. IPT is now a recommended approach to the prevention of malaria in pregnancy (sometimes called IPTp), and is administered at antenatal clinic visits.  IPT is being explored as a potential way of preventing malaria in infants (IPTi), potentially linked with routine immunisation schedules.  IPT in young children (IPTc) is the subject of new research.
