Brill-Zinnser disease is a delayed re-infection of epidemic typhus that comes back after months or years of dormancy. It is not usually as severe as the original infection, but it is still treated with a course of antibiotics. Completing the first course of antibiotics after the initial typhus infection, instead of ending it prematurely, may reduce the chance of a relapse of the infection later on.
