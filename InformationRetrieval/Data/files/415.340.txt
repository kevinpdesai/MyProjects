EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS
The scientific community is working on medications that can help Ebola patients. Thus far, these treatments are considered experimental. Most have not been tested rigorously on humans yet. Some are drugs already approved for human use, but for other illnesses. Using them against Ebola is a new application and thus it is not known how effective or safe they may be. The United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has an FAQ on experimental treatments.
