 More than 100 health-care workers have been exposed to the virus while caring for Ebola patients. This happens because they may not have been wearing personal protection equipment or were not properly applying infection prevention and control measures when caring for the patients. Health-care providers at all levels of the health system â€“ hospitals, clinics, and health posts â€“ should be briefed on the nature of the disease and how it is transmitted, and strictly follow recommended infection control precautions.
