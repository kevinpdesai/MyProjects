Avoid mosquito bites
Mosquitoes that carry malaria bite particularly at twilight and at night, so you should take most precautions during this time.Sleep in rooms that are properly screened with gauze over the windows and doors. There should be no holes in the gauze and no unscreened entry points to the room. Air-conditioned rooms are good, too.
