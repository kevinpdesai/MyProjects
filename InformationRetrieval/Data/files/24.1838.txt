There are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines or therapeutics available for prevention, postexposure, or treatment for EVD. Clinical management of EVD should focus on supportive care of complications, such as hypovolemia, electrolyte abnormalities, hematologic abnormalities, refractory shock, hypoxia, hemorrhage, septic shock, multiorgan failure, and DIC.
