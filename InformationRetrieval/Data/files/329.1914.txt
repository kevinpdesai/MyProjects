WH: What’s the actual fatality rate? I’ve heard between 60 and 90 percent. Is that accurate?
Dr. Lahey:
I suspect the death rates we’re hearing quoted are probably not as applicable in the United States or Europe. The thing that causes death from Ebola is organ failure and sepsis, and that is very difficult to treat in Sierra Leone, for instance. But in the United States we have great ICU care, and are much better equipped to prevent that. If someone’s blood pressure is low, I can give them medicines to make it go higher. If their kidney is failing I can give them dialysis until their kidneys heal.
