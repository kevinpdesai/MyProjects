Prevention of typhus outbreaks takes a two-pronged approach. Eliminating the carriers and reservoirs of Rickettsia is an important step in prevention. Spraying with insecticides, rodent control measures, and treating soil with insect-repellent chemicals have all been used successfully to prevent typhus outbreaks. In scrub typhus islands, cutting down vegetation has been shown to lessen the incidence of scrub typhus.
