While water and sanitation systems and community education campaigns are the most effective cholera prevention methods, the World Health Organization does recognize that there are two safe and effective oral vaccinations available for cholera - Dukoral and Shanchol. Both vaccines are administered in two doses, six weeks apart, and can be used in areas where cholera is endemic, but they should not replace larger prevention mechanisms, such as safe water and sanitation systems and community health education.
