The natural reservoir host for Ebola virus is believed to be bats. The way in which outbreaks in humans begin is not certain, but researchers believe that the first patient becomes infected through contact with an infected animal.  Humans can then transmit the infection to other humans, by direct contact through broken skin or mucous membranes with a sick person's blood or body fluids (urine, saliva, feces, vomit, and semen) or with objects (such as needles) that have been contaminated with infected body fluids.  Humans with Ebola become infectious once they begin to have symptoms.  Healthcare workers and the family and friends in close contact with Ebola patients are at the highest risk of getting sick because they may come in contact with infected blood or body fluids.
