Malaria is a serious disease that once seemed to be headed for the history books. From the 1940s through about 1970, it was disappearing. Insecticides, or insect-killing chemicals, had been developed for killing the mosquitoes that carry malaria before they could spread the disease. In addition, an inexpensive medicine called chloroquine had been developed for killing the malaria parasite after humans had been infected.
