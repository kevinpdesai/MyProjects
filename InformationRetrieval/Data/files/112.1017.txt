Schedule a doctor's appointment 6 weeks in advance of your trip. Start your trip planning early so you can start taking preventative medication before you set out on your journey. Schedule an appointment with your doctor to take place at least 6 weeks before you leave. As an alternative, you may schedule an appointment at a travel clinic in your area.
