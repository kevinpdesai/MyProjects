As written in the “Ebola and Quarantine” article in the New England Journal of Medicine, “transmission [of Ebola] arises from contact with bodily fluids of a person who is symptomatic- that is, has a fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and malaise…. Therefore, an asymptomatic health care worker returning from treating patients with Ebola, even if he or she were infected, would not be contagious.” States such as New Jersey and New York are enforcing health care workers returning from Ebola-affected regions to submit themselves to quarantine, despite whether or not they are displaying symptoms; this policy is completely unnecessary and overly cautious. The article states that many people suggest that the law is harmless because it is only slightly “inconveniencing health care workers” for the sake of “just in case” protection. The authors reply to these notions by saying, “to stop an epidemic of this type requires controlling it at its source… we need tens of thousands of additional volunteers to control the epidemic… If we add barriers, making it harder for volunteers to return to their community, we are hurting ourselves.” In fact, an example of how these barriers have affected medical personal has unfolded in Louisiana.
