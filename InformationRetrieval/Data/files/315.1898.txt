If malaria is diagnosed and treated promptly, virtually everyone will make a full recovery. Treatment should be started as soon as the diagnosis has been confirmed.
Anti-malarial medication is used both to treat and prevent malaria. Which drug used and the length of treatment will depend on:
the type of malaria
the severity of your symptoms
where you caught malaria
whether you have taken an anti-malarial to prevent malaria 
whether you are pregnant
