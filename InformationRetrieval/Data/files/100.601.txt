For standard, non-complicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria, the World Health Organisation recommends use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), such as Coartem. This is due to increasing levels of resistance to chloroquine in many parts of the world. Indeed, even though chloroquine is still used in many places as first-line treatment against P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale and P. knowlesi uncomplicated malaria, there is some evidence that resistance to this treatment is also emerging, for example in P. vivax in parts of south-east Asia.
