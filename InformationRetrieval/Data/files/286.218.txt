A history of primary exposure usually involves travel to or work in an Ebola-endemic area, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC; formerly Zaire), Sudan, Gabon, or Côte d’Ivoire. A history of exposure to tropical African forests is more common in patients with primary exposure to Ebola than is a history of working within cities in the same region.
