You should always consider taking antimalarial medicine when travelling to areas where there is a risk of malaria. Visit your GP or local travel clinic for malaria advice as soon as you know when and where you are going to be travelling.
It is very important that you take the correct dose and that you finish the course of antimalarial treatment. If you are unsure, check with your GP or pharmacist how long you should take your medication for.
