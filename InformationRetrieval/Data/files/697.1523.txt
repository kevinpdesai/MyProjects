For how long is a patient of malaria infectious to others after onset of
symptoms?
In vivax malaria the patient is practically immediately infectious to mosquitos after
the onset of symptoms. In falciparum malaria the patient is infectious only after
several days when mature sexual forms of the parasites (gametocytes) appear in
the peripheral bloodstream.
