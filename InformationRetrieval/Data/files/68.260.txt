Flies can spread cholera. It is important to keep food covered to prevent them from transmitting cholera. Flies are attracted to garbage and human waste, so keep garbage far away from food, and cover it if all possible. Ideally, toilets will be sealed so that flies cannot enter into them. The seating area can be sealed so that when the lid closes, flies cannot get into the toilet area. It is well worth taking the time to do this to keep the fly population down as they spread many types of diseases in the tropics.
