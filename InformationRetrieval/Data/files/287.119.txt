The active section of the mouse antibody against Ebola was then placed on the human antibody that was modified to carry the part of the mouse antibody that is effective in limiting or stopping Ebola replication. These chimeric antibodies (one antibody type produced from two different antibodies) were reproduced in Chinese hamster ovary cells and in plant cells that were genetically modified to produce large amounts of chimeric antibodies. These antibodies were then purified and concentrated. In a small study with rhesus macaque monkeys, these antibodies were shown to protect the monkeys from early Ebola virus exposure. They were also successful in reducing or eliminating Ebola viral symptoms in monkeys with ongoing Ebola infection.
