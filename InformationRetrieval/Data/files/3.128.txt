Ebolaviruses contain single-stranded, non-infectious RNA genomes.[ 29] Ebolavirus genomes contain seven genes including 3'-UTR-NP-VP35-VP40-GP-VP30-VP24-L-5'-UTR.[ 21] [ 30] The genomes of the five different ebolaviruses (BDBV, EBOV, RESTV, SUDV and TAFV) differ in sequence and the number and location of gene overlaps. As with all filoviruses, ebolavirus virions are filamentous particles that may appear in the shape of a shepherd's crook, of a "U" or of a "6," and they may be coiled, toroid or branched.[ 30] [ 31] In general, ebolavirions are 80 nanometers (nm) in width and may be as long as 14,000 nm.[ 32]
