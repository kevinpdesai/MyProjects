There is no medication to cure Ebola and no vaccine to prevent it. Vaccines are in development, but none have been approved yet.
Treatment for Ebola is supportive, meaning providing fluids, maintaining blood pressure, and replacing lost blood.
Seeking health care as soon as symptoms appear increases the chances of surviving.
