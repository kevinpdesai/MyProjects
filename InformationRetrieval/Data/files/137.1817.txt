A total of 93 patients were randomly assigned to receive either a single 500-mg dose of azithromycin or a 1-week course of daily oral 200-mg dose of doxycycline. Cure was achieved in 47 (100%) of 47 patients in the azithromycin-treated group and in 43 (93.5%) of 46 patients in the doxycycline-treated group (P = .117). The median time to defervescence was 21 h for the azithromycin-treated group and 29 h for the doxycycline-treated group (P = .097). There were no serious adverse events during the study. No relapses occurred in either group during a 1-month follow-up period.
