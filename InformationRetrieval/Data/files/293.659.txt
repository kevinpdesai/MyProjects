The mainstay in scrub-typhus diagnostics remains serology. The oldest test in current use is the Weil–Felix OX-K agglutination reaction, which is inexpensive, easy to perform, and results are available overnight; however, it lacks specificity and sensitivity3 (Table 1). The indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test is more sensitive, and results are available in a couple of hours; however, the test is more expensive and requires considerable training (Table 1). IFA uses fluorescent anti-human antibody to detect specific antibody from patient serum bound to a smear of scrub-typhus antigen and is currently the reference standard.4 Indirect immunoperoxidase (IIP) eliminates the expense of a fluorescent microscope by substituting peroxidase for fluorescein (Table 1).3
