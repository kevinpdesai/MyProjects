MRSA is a bacterial infection, not a virus, and unlike a virus, it is treatable with extremely potent antibiotics, usually by IV over many weeks. People carry the staphylococcus aureus bacterium naturally on their skin without getting sick from it, as long as they maintain a strong immune system and do not demand an antibiotic for every little sore throat, and when they really do need an antibiotic, they make sure to take it all, and don’t stop when they feel better. I know this from experience, since I had to take IV treatment for 6 weeks in a hospital 8 years ago. Have had no sign of infection since then. Note: I did not contract the infection while in the hospital. I believe it started from a supposedly healed boil.
