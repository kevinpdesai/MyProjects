Previous outbreaks of Ebola have been small and localized, but this one is much broader. Why the difference?
Typically, when we have an outbreak of Ebola, a team goes in, they identify the cases, they identify people who might come into contact with the cases. And as a result of isolation, we're able to contain the outbreak and it peters out fairly rapidly. Here, it's in urban areas as opposed to rural areas. There isn't enough manpower to track all these cases and make certain we educate people, and that's what's essential.
