The type of medicine prescribed and the duration of treatment can vary from person to person. It depends on various factors such as the type of malaria that you have, if you have taken any anti-malarial medication when you were travelling, and the severity of your symptoms. If your symptoms are mild then you will be treated at home. However, if you have Plasmodium falciparum malaria then it is very likely you will be treated and monitored in hospital.
