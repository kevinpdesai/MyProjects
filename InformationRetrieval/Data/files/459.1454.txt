Malaria, spread by the night-biting female Anopheles mosquito, is another serious illness that is mainly found in India, Indonesia (but not on the coast of Bali) and Indochina. Some parts of China, North Korea and South Korea may also pose a malaria risk, but there is little or no risk in Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Mongolia, Singapore, Brunei or the Maldives. There is no risk of malaria in most of Asiaâ€™s seaside resorts including popular Thailand resort towns.
