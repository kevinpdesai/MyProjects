Probabilities for treatment, hospitalization, and death vary according to a country’s WHO Epidemiological Region. If a case occurred in a country with reduced access to formal health care, then there was a higher probability of no treatment, hospitalization, and death. Our cholera incidence assumptions were derived from case estimates in Ali et al (2012) with further guidance from Dr. David Sack of Johns Hopkins University.2,3 The remaining probabilities are based on assumptions made by the IDCC authors from the UPMC Center for Health Security.
