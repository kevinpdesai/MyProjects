Your doctor will perform a blood test. The blood sample will be sent to the laboratory and will be examined for the presence of the malaria parasite. The type of malaria causing the infection will also be determined. If the first blood test is negative but your doctor suspects you have malaria, then you may be asked to have another blood test taken a couple of days later.
