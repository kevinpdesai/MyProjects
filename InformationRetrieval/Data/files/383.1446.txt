People suspected of having the disease must immediately be reported to the local health department. In order for them to survive, prompt medical attention is essential. If they receive essential care, their likelihood of survival vastly improves. Controlling the spread is also vitally important. Infection control procedures, such as those recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) must commence immediately. Should a person have travelled to a locale known to have an Ebola outbreak, or have come into contact with a known or suspected Ebola victim and s/he starts to feel symptomatic, medical attention must be sought at once.
