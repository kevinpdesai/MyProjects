According to the CDC, the first quarantine station in the United States was built in 1799 at the port of Philadelphia, six years after a yellow fever outbreak began there. It would take nearly a century before Congress passed the National Quarantine Act in 1878, officially giving the power of quarantine to the federal government. The federal system was then incrementally beefed up over the next several decades, and in 1944 the Public Health Service Act codified the government’s responsibility for preventing the spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries to the United States.
