Most infections occur in travellers returning to the UK (rather than visitors coming to the UK). The risk of getting malaria is greatest if you do not take your anti-malarial medication or do not take it properly. People who take last-minute holidays and also those visiting friends or relatives abroad have been shown to be the least likely to take their anti-malarial medication.
