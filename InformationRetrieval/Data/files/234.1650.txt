After a week or so, the now distended liver cell bursts open, releasing the merozoites into the blood stream, where they can only survive if they rapidly attach to and enter host red blood cells. Now the parasite is in a protected environment, shielded from detection or attack by the host's immune system. Inside the red blood cell, the parasite again grows and divides â€“ this time forming up to 32 daughter merozoites. After around 48 hours, the host red blood cell bursts releasing merozoites into the blood to repeat the whole cycle.
