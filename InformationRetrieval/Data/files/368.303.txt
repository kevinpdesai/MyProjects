Ebola virus disease (EVD) (formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever) is a severe disease caused by a virus of the filovirus family, which occurs in humans and other primates. The disease emerged in 1976 in almost simultaneous outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Sudan. Ebola then disappeared after 1979 and was not recognized again until 1994, and outbreaks have been occurring with increasing frequency since.
