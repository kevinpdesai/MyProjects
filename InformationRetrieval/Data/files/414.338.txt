The Ebola virus has been a controversial topic since its discovery in 1976, having achieved considerable fame in the 1990's through the media and such works of fiction as the novel The Hot Zone and the film Outbreak. However little information regarding the virus' virulence and transmission methods is known by the general public, thus making it one of the most globally feared viruses. It has been speculated that one of the virus' strains--Ebola Reston--has "airborne" qualities, therefore making it transmittable via, well, air.
