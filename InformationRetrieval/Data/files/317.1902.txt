Cholera is a potentially fatal diarrheal disease of the small intestine caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. The infection spreads through the fecal-oral route following the consumption of water or foods (usually raw or undercooked seafood) contaminated with the bacterium. V. cholerae does not invade the inner tissues of the body, but colonizes in the small intestine, where it produces a potent toxin. The toxin then triggers a profuse watery diarrhea, which can result in a critical loss of fluid, salts, and minerals (electrolytes). Symptoms usually become apparent within 2 to 3 days following infection, but that period may vary from only a few hours to 5 days. Consequences range from mild to life-threatening. Without treatment, the outcome may be dehydration, drop in blood pressure (hypotension), hypovolemic shock, and death within hours.
