That same year, another outbreak occurred in Sudan, affecting 284 people and killing 53 percent of those who got sick (151 people). The disease spread through close personal contact in hospitals and a number of hospital personnel were infected, according to the CDC.
In 1995 there was another outbreak of Ebola in Zaire in which 315 people got sick and 81 percent of them (250 people) died. Again it spread mostly through families and hospitals before being stamped out.
