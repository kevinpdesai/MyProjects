Cholera organism is known to be present in some rivers along the eastern Australian coast, but cholera acquired in Australia is very rare. In Australia, because of our high standards of sanitation, water and food quality, cholera outbreaks do not occur. Typically, cholera is seen only in travellers arriving from countries where the disease is still common, such as Africa, Central Europe, Latin America and Asia.
