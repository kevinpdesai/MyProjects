The incubation differs for typhoid and paratyphoid fever: typhoid fever is usually 8-14 days but this depends on the infective dose and can vary from three days to one month paratyphoid fever is usually one to ten days. Typhoid and paratyphoid infections occur worldwide. Outbreaks occur in areas with poor sanitation and inadequate sewerage systems. Approximately 5 to 60 cases of typhoid and paratyphoid fever occur in Victoria each year. The majority of these are returned travellers, especially from the Indian subcontinent.
