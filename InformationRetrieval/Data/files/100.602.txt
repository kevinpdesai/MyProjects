In cases where malaria infection has progressed to a stage where oral administration of medication is not possible, or where cerebral symptoms are suspected, the usual treatment option is intravenous quinine.
In addition, P. vivax and P. ovale malaria parasites are able to produce forms (called hypnozoites) which can become dormant in liver hepatocyte cells after the blood stages of the infection have been cleared. These dormant forms can become reactivated weeks or even months or years after the initial infection, which is called a relapse of the infection. One drug, called primaquine, is able to kill these liver stages, and so patients with either of these types of malaria should also discuss the possibility of taking primaquine.
