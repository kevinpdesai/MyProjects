Our estimates suggest larger variability in the incubation period with O1 El Tor Ogawa than other toxigenic strains, with some cases expected to become symptomatic over a week after infection. We re-estimated the incubation period for toxigenic cholera with this influential data removed and found the median incubation period is 1.5 (95% CI 1.4–1.7) days with a dispersion of 1.62 (95% CI 1.54–1.71). Five percent of cases will develop symptoms by 0.7 (95% CI 0.6–0.8) days, with 95% developing symptoms by 3.4 (95% CI 3.1–3.9) days after infection
