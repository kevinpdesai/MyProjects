The incubation period of malaria (the time from when the parasite enters the body, to the development of symptoms) varies depending on which Plasmodium species is causing the infection. During this incubation period the parasite undergoes an initial period of development in the liver, after which it infects red blood cells. For P. falciparum, the incubation period is 7 to 14 days. For P. vivax and P. ovale infection, the incubation period is typically 12 to 18 days, but can be a lot longer (months or years in some cases) due to a longer liver stage
