Typhoid bacteria can persist in the bile passages of patients for an indefinite period of time. These carriers can pass the infection to healthy persons if they practice poor hygiene or if they are food handlers. About 30 percent of persons infected with typhus fever become transient carriers of the disease, excreting the causative bacteria in the stool or urine for weeks or months. About 5 percent remain long-term carriers, harbouring the microorganisms and shedding them for years. One of the most famous instances of carrier-borne disease in medical history was the case of “Typhoid Mary” (byname of Mary Mallon). Fifty-one original cases of typhoid and three deaths were directly attributed to her during the early 20th century.
