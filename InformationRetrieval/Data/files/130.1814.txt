Both types of typhus infection are usually treated with a course of oral antibiotics. Tetracycline and doxycycline are the most common antibiotics used to treat typhus infections because of their high efficacy against Rickettsia bacteria and low risk of serious side effects, but other antibiotics, such as chloramphenicol or azithromycin, are also used in some cases. Tetracycline is not usually recommended for young children, because it causes permanent discoloration of teeth that have not yet erupted. It is important to take the entire course of antibiotic therapy, even after symptoms subside, to completely clear the infection. In treating a typhus infection, it is important to start antibiotic therapy as soon as possible, to prevent serious complications such as kidney damage, lung damage or nervous system complications. People with more severe cases of epidemic typhus may also need hospitalization and additional treatments, such as IV fluids or oxygen therapy.
