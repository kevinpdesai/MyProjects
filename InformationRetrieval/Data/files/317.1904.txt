Prompt fluid and electrolyte replacement is the foundation of effective treatment. Although not critical to outcome, the administration of antibiotics, usually a single dose of doxycycline or azithromycin, reduces the recovery time; the appropriate antibiotic depends on the individual's age and the drug resistance patterns of the bacterium. Oral fluid replacement may be sufficient for mild cases; however, severe dehydration requires intravenous drips in the form of lactated Ringer solution—an intravenous solution administered to supply water and critical electrolytes such as calcium, potassium, sodium, and chloride. Supplemental potassium is often administered beyond that found in standard Ringer's lactate solution. The addition of glucose further hastens recovery. The individual's urine output, thirst, and skin turgor help gauge the status of hydration. The medical caretaker should carefully chart fluid output and intake volumes, and periodically review this data. Vaccines are available, but results are mixed. Currently, US citizens traveling to endemic areas are only given the vaccine if required by the country of destination.
