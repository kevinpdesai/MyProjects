Symptoms of malaria usually occur between one to four weeks after the initial mosquito bite. However, in some cases, depending on the type of plasmodium you are infected with, it can take up to a year before any symptoms start to show. This means that you should suspect malaria in anyone with a feverish illness who has travelled to a malaria area within the past year, especially in the previous three months.
