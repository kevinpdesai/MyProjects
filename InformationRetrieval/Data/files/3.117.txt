EBOV is thought to infect humans through contact with mucous membranes or through skin breaks.[ 37] Once infected, endothelial cells (cells lining the inside of blood vessels), liver cells, and several types of immune cells such as macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells are the main targets of infection.[ 37] Following infection with the virus, the immune cells carry the virus to nearby lymph nodes where further reproduction of the virus takes place.[ 37] From there, the virus can enter the bloodstream and lymphatic system and spread throughout the body.[ 37] Macrophages are the first cells infected with the virus, and this infection results in programmed cell death.[ 32] Other types of white blood cells, such as lymphocytes, also undergo programmed cell death leading to an abnormally low concentration of lymphocytes in the blood.[ 37] This contributes to the weakened immune response seen in those infected with EBOV.[ 37]
