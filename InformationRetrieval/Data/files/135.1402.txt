Depending on the overall malaria risk at your destination, it might be necessary to practise malaria prophylaxis, either on a daily or a weekly basis. Consult with a travel clinic, healthcare provider or an online doctor service like ours (www.dred.com) well before your departure to discuss your specific preventive needs. Depending on the medication you use, you will have to start taking the medication up to two weeks before entering the risk area. In areas of intermediate risk, it might be sufficient to carry a treatment course with you as a stand-by medication. You would only start taking the medication if you experience any flu-like symptoms during your journey.
