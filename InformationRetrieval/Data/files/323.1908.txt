The acute condition caused by cholera toxin is known as "rice water" stool, because the free enterocytes in the almost clear liquid stool give the appearance of rice grains. Oral re-hydration with saline solution is the recommended supportive therapy that has saved countless millions of lives. Antibiotics can reduce the length of time for the diarrheal portion of the illness, but is often in short supply or not available at all. The cholera organism "burns out" on its own within 5-6 days and the patient experiences an uneventful recovery.
