Doing 'the impossible'Dr. Myron Levine of the Center for Vaccine Development at the University of Maryland is working on a vaccine trial in Mali. He said it typically takes about a decade get a vaccine tested and licensed for general use, but this is uncharted territory.“We’ve already kind of done the impossible, he said. Lots of folks said there is no way we could go from a vaccine in August that had never been in a human being and complete dose-response phase 1 [trials] in West Africans within a few months. They said it was impossible. Well, impossible, you can cross out that word. It’s been done.
