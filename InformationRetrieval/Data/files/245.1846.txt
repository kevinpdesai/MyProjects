With no known cure (several are in testing) for the disease, the only treatments available are labeled as “supportive intensive care” and are administered to treat the symptoms and provide some small level of comfort. During outbreaks, the people who are most at risk are healthcare workers, family members and any others who come into close and/or frequent contact with infected individuals, alive or deceased.
