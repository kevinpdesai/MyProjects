Dr. Kent Brantly — the first person infected with Ebola on U.S. soil — climbed out of an ambulance with the help of another person, who steadied the 33-year-old doctor as they walked the short length to an entrance at Emory University Hospital. Brantly was dressed in a hooded biocontainment suit while his guide also wore elaborate protective gear.
