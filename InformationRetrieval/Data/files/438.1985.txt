The tetracyclines and chloramphenicol remain the standard reference treatment for scrub typhus (Table 1). Unless contraindicated, doxycycline is the preferred treatment and the usual adult oral dose is 100 mg twice daily for 7 days. Tetracycline taken at 500 mg every 6h for 7 days may be also used. Few studies have shown that shorter courses of doxycycline treatment (single dose, or 3-day regimen) were comparable to the standard duration; however, rigorous studies of shorter duration of therapy are indicated. The use of doxycycline is limited by its contraindication in pregnant women and young children or its side effects including photosensitivity and gastrointestinal symptoms.
