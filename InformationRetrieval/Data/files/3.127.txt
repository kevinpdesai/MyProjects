EVD in humans is caused by four of five viruses of the genus Ebolavirus. The four are Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), Sudan virus (SUDV), TaÃ¯ Forest virus (TAFV) and one simply called Ebola virus (EBOV, formerly Zaire Ebola virus).[ 25] EBOV, species Zaire ebolavirus, is the most dangerous of the known EVD-causing viruses, and is responsible for the largest number of outbreaks.[ 26] The fifth virus, Reston virus (RESTV), is not thought to cause disease in humans, but has caused disease in other primates.[ 27] [ 28] All five viruses are closely related to marburgviruses.[ 25]
