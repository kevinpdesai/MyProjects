In older studies when used with treatments not currently recommended, two studies showed that primaquine at doses of 0.75 mg/kg reduced the number of mosquitoes infected after biting humans (low quality evidence). Doses above 0.4 mg/kg reduced the duration of detectable gametocytes (high quality evidence). No studies examined primaquine using the low dose currently recommended.
