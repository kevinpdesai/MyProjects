Someone who has been exposed to hepatitis B may have symptoms any time from 6 weeks to 6 months later. Some people with hepatitis B don't notice symptoms until they become quite severe. Some have few or no symptoms, but even someone who doesn't have any symptoms can still transmit the disease to others, and can still develop complications later in life.
