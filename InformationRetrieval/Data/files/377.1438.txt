Infection with typhoid or paratyphoid fever,typhus results in a very low-grade septicemia. A single blood culture is positive in only half of cases. Stool culture is not usually positive during the early phase of the disease. Bone marrow culture increases the diagnostic yield to about 80% of cases. The Widal test is an old serologic assay for detecting IgM and IgG to the O and H antigens of salmonella. The test is unreliable but is widely used in most developing countries because of its low cost. Newer serologic assays for S. enterica serotype Typhi infection are occasionally used in outbreak situations and are somewhat more sensitive and specific than the Widal test, but are not an adequate substitute for blood, stool, or bone marrow culture. Because there is no definitive serologic test for typhoid or paratyphoid fever, the initial diagnosis often has to be made clinically. The combination of a history of risk for infection and a gradual onset of fever that increases in severity over several days should raise suspicion of typhoid or paratyphoid fever.
