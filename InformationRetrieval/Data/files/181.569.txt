I believe that returning health care workers should be checked for symptoms of Ebola before departure to the United States, at arrival into the country, and for 21 consecutive days after, but that health care workers should not have to be quarantined unless deemed necessary by exuding symptoms of Ebola. Instead, healthy medical personnel should return home to the States with warm greetings and honor, and should be able to continue to live their lives according to their own individual and unique desires.
