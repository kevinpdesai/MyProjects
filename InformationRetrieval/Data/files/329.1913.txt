WH: How long does it take for someone to clinically “recover” from the virus?
Dr. Lahey:
Couple weeks. Usually the easy way to remember it is on average it takes 2 weeks from exposure to develop symptoms, and from the time you develop symptoms, death will occur within a couple of weeks, or you’ll survive. Something like 40 percent of people survive. Ebola
