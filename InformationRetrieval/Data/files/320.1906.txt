Bacterial community dynamics in children suffering from cholera and during recovery period were examined in the present study by employing metagenomic tool, followed by DNA sequencing and analysis. For this, bacterial community DNA was extracted from fecal samples of nine clinically confirmed cholera children (age 2–3 years) at day 0 (acute cholera), day 2 (antibiotic therapy), day 7 and, and day 28, and the variable region of 16S rRNA genes were amplified by universal primer PCR.
