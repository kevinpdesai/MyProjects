Use a mosquito net over your bed to prevent Malaria. Make sure that it’s impregnated with an insecticide and doesn’t have any holes in it. Ideally the net should to be long enough to reach the floor but if not, tuck it in under the mattress.
Spray your room with an insecticide before you go to bed.
Use an electrical device that vaporises an insect repellent tablet in your room at night.
Cover doors and windows with fine mesh netting.
Use air conditioning or a fan in your room, as mosquitoes are less active in cooler temperatures.
