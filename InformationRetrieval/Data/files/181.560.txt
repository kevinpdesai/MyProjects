Homeopathy cannot self-correct because inherent in self-correction is the willingness to admit you are wrong, as scientists did when they accepted that stomach ulcers are caused by helicobacter pylori, not stress. Homeopaths cannot admit that like does not cure like, that dilution does not increase potency, and that miasms do not cause diseases by disturbing the body’s vital force – since neither exist – because those things are the very definition of homeopathy.
