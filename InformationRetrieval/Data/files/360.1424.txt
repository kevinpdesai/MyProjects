Malaria typically produces a series of recurrent attacks, each of which has three stages: chills, followed by fever, and then sweating (NIAID). Symptoms can begin mildly, as drowsiness, irritability, loss of appetite, or trouble sleeping. These symptoms typically escalate within 24 hours into the recurring cycles of chills, fever, and sweating. Chills typically last for Malaria  and can be accompanied by convulsions or violent shaking. Along with chills, the person is likely to have headache, malaise, fatigue, muscular pains, occasional nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. During the fever stage, body temperature rises (as high as 107 degrees F; CDC, 2010b) and the skin feels hot and dry.  After three or four hours of fever, body temperature returns to normal, signaling the beginning of the “wet stage” of profuse sweating, which lasts 2 to 4 hours.
