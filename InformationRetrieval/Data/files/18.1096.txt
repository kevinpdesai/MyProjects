In areas where endemic typhus is found, or in outbreaks of epidemic typhus, efforts to treat domestic animals to rid them of fleas are good preventive measures.
Boil clothing during outbreaks, if possible. If not, avoid any physical contact with infested clothing for five days to allow the lice to die.
