Typhus is caused by 2 types of bacteria: Rickettsia typhi or Rickettsia prowazekii.
Rickettsia typhi causes endemic or murine typhus.
Endemic typhus is uncommon in the United States. It is usually seen in areas where hygiene is poor and the temperature is cold. Endemic typhus is sometimes called "jail fever." The bacteria that causes this type is usually spread from rats to fleas to humans.
Murine typhus occurs in the southern United States, particularly California and Texas. It is often seen during the summer and fall. It is rarely deadly. You are more likely to get this type of typhus if you are around rat feces or fleas, and other animals such as cats, possums, raccoons, and skunks.
Rickettsia prowazekii causes epidemic typhus. It is spread by lice.
