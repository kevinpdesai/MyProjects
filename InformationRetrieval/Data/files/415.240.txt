Zmapp
This experimental treatment, made by Mapp Biopharmaceutical, is a combination of three antibodies created in plants. The antibodies are thought to block or neutralise the Ebola virus. A few healthcare workers who were infected while treating Ebola patients have taken ZMapp. Some recovered, but others did not and subsequently died. On 12 August, the manufacturer announced that supplies had been exhausted. Any decision to use an experimental drug in a patient would be a decision made by the treating physician under the regulatory guidelines of the FDA. Mapp and its partners are cooperating with appropriate government agencies to increase production as quickly as possible.
