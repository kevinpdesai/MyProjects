So should we be worried about Ebola's evolution at all? Yes. Researchers studying the recent epidemic found that the virus is accumulating many mutations in the region of its genome that diagnostic tests use to identify the disease. Too many mutations of this sort could render our standard tests inaccurate, making it much more difficult to diagnose Ebola infections and hampering the medical community's ability to treat and contain the virus. Such changes could also impact vaccine development and therapies for treating the disease. While Ebola's ongoing evolution is unlikely to lead to an airborne virus, it is likely to lead to other changes that will affect how we fight this deadly outbreak.
