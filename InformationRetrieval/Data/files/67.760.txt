Cholera is not a problem in developed countries, but it is a major public health problem for developing countries, where outbreaks occur seasonally and are associated with poverty and poor sanitation. The disease causes profuse watery diarrhea that leads to rapid dehydration and—if not treated—death. Serious disasters, such as hurricanes, typhoons, or earthquakes, cause a disruption in water systems resulting in the mixing of drinking and waste waters, which increase the risk of contracting cholera among area residents.
