When added to currently recommended treatments for malaria (artemisinin-based combination therapy), we found no studies evaluating the effects of primaquine on the number of mosquitoes infected. However, primaquine does reduce the duration of infectiousness of the human host to mosquitoes (defined as the period that gametocytes are detected circulating in the blood) when given at doses greater than 0.6 mg/kg (high quality evidence) and at doses between 0.4 and 0.6 mg/kg (moderate quality evidence). We only found one study using 0.1 mg/kg with an estimate consistent with a smaller reduction in gametocytes, but the analysis was underpowered and did not reach statistical significance (low quality evidence).
