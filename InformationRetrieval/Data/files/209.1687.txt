 Bats drop partially eaten fruits and pulp onto the ground then land mammals such as gorillas and duikers feed on these fallen fruits. This chain of events forms a possible indirect means of transmission from the natural host to animal populations, which has led to research towards viral shedding in the saliva of bats. Fruit bats are also eaten by people in parts of West Africa where they are smoked, grilled or made into a spicy soup. (Diagram 3)
