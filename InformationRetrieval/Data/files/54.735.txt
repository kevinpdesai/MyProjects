Murine (endemic) typhus is an uncommon flea-borne infectious disease caused by Rickettsia typhi. The illness is less commonly diagnosed in the United States than in the developing world because of improvements in hygiene and rat control efforts. The true incidence of this infection is difficult to establish because of the difficulty in distinguishing murine typhus from other causes of rash and fever.
