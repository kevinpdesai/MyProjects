The bacteria which cause endemic and epidemic typhus are not transmitted directly by bites, but by contamination of the bite site with infected louse faeces which are then inoculated by human excoriation. They then parasitise the endothelial cells of blood vessels, causing a multisystem vasculitis. Orientia tsutsugamushi is transmitted by the ovaries of trombiculid mites. The offspring infected mites are known as chiggers, and pass the infection directly to humans.NEW - log your activity Add notes to any clinical page and create a reflective diary Automatically track and log every page you have viewed Print and export a summary to use in your appraisalClick to find out more Â»Epidemiology[1] Epidemic typhus fever
