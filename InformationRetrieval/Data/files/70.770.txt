Epidemic typhus occurs in communities and refugee populations where body lice are prevalent. Outbreaks often occur during the colder months when infested clothing is not laundered. Travelers at most risk for epidemic typhus include those who may work with or visit areas with large homeless populations, impoverished areas, refugee camps, and regions that have recently experienced war or natural disasters. Active foci of endemic typhus are known in the Andes regions of South America and in Burundi and Ethiopia. Sylvatic epidemic typhus cases occur only from direct contact with flying squirrels or their nesting materials and squirrel ecoparasites in the eastern United States. Tick-associated reservoirs of R. prowazekii have been described in Ethiopia, Mexico, and Brazil.
