I have been hearing/reading to reports regarding the recent Ebola epidemic on several media outlets, newspaper, radio and television news. I have heard multiple times through these various outlets that two American medical aid workers who have contracted the disease were being evacuated from Liberia to be brought to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital, which is equipped to handle patients and provide the maximum protection for the staff.
