Malaria can be diagnosed by looking at blood samples; the parasites are visible under the microscope. After malaria is diagnosed, treatment should begin immediately. The treatment of malaria subsides its symptoms and cures it within two weeks. Without proper treatment, malaria episodes (fever, chills, sweating) can return periodically over a period of years.
