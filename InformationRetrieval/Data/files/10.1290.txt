 There is still limited access to diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis B in many resource-constrained settings, and many people are diagnosed only when they already have advanced liver disease.

In high-income countries, surgery and chemotherapy can prolong life for up to a few years. In high-income countries, liver transplantation is sometimes used in people with cirrhosis, with varying success.
