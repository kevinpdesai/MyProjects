Compared to diseases like smallpox and tuberculosis, which have been around for thousands of years, cholera is a relatively new disease. Its origins can be traced to India in 1826, but by 1830, 40,000 people a year were dying from cholera. In 1831, nearly 200,000 Russians died. The same year, cholera spread to Poland, Hungary, and Germany, killing hundreds of thousands. As it spread throughout Europe, the death toll rose dramatically. In 1848, Russia alone suffered 3 million deaths! Large outbreaks continued for many decades, killing hundreds of thousands of Europeans each year.
