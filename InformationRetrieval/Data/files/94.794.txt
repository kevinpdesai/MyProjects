The discovery of the insecticide DDT in 1942 and its first use in Italy in 1944 made the ideal of global eradication of malaria seem possible. In the 1950s and 1960s, DDT lowered malaria rates in many parts of the world. However, due to environmental toxicity, it was abandoned. Predictably, malaria rates increased. DDT has been replaced by newer insecticides, which have fewer health risks.
Disease management through early diagnosis and prompt treatment is fundamental to malaria control. Even with the emergence of drug resistance, malaria is largely a curable disease.
