Typhus fever is transmitted from person to person by the body louse, which feeds on
the blood of humans. Infected lice excrete rickettsiae in their feces and usually defecate at the time of
feeding. People are infected when they rub feces or crush lice in the bite, superficial abrasions, or mucous
membranes. Inhalation of infective louse feces in dust may account for some infections. Transmission
has also been associated with contact with infected flying squirrels in the United States, their nests, or
their ectoparasites.
