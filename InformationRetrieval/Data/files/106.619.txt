Since the total economic cost borne by each country depends largely on case incidence, use of official numbers would lead to significant underestimation of total cost. To counter this underreporting, we calculate the number of cholera cases by using incidence numbers estimated and published in the literature.2,3 Specifically, we use the incidence rates for endemic countries from Ali and colleagues (2012) and apply them to 2010 population data.
