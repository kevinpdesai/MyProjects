Dr. Rowen is deeply concerned about what's happening in Sierra Leone, as well as other areas affected by Ebola. According to contacts on the ground, it appears the lives of those in Sierra Leone mean little to nothing—unless, that is, they survive Ebola. Then, they can get paid for their blood, which is given to the rich who get infected. Perhaps that is why those running these killing fields may not care about ozone therapy, he suggests. And, if that can happen in Sierra Leone, it can certainly happen in the US as well.
