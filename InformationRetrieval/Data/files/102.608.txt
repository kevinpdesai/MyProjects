Dr. Craig Spencer, the first patient with Ebola in New York City and the latest to be diagnosed in the U.S., has received Brincidofovir, the same drug that was given to Duncan, and to Ashoka Mukpo, a freelance journalist who was cured.
It is a tablet that is swallowed. Chimerix, the company that makes the drug, has said that it has adequate supply, and is currently in discussions with global organizations and government agencies on providing it outside the U.S., though specifics have not yet been determined. The drug has been tested in human trials to treat other viruses, and has shown potential in test-tube evaluations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health. It is an antiviral, meaning it tries to stop the Ebola virus from copying itself once inside the body.
