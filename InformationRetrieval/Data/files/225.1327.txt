 New anti-malaria compound destroys parasite quickly - one of the challenges in the fight against malaria is that it rapidly becomes resistant to new drugs. To sustain their effectiveness, new drugs need to act fast and eliminate the parasite before it has a chance to develop resistance. Now, a new study offers such a compound - in mice it removed all traces of malaria parasite within 48 hours.
