Vaccines in development have been effective at preventing Ebola infections in animal studies, researchers from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) report. The research, on apes in particular, is controversial because ape populations are dwindling and in danger of extinction. It is very difficult to test effectiveness of an experimental vaccine in people, Pigott says, because it's unlikely anyone is going to let you inject them with Ebola and later see whether or not they get the infection. However, safety testing of new vaccines in people where the infections are ongoing is now underway.
