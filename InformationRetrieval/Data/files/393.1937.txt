The mortality risk is highest in individuals older than age 45 and in those with greater numbers of virus particles; the risk of death is highest in those experiencing multi-system signs and symptoms, including hemorrhagic complications. Mortality risk is lower in those with milder disease and those whose immune systems mount strong defenses. Deaths typically occur between days 6 and 16 after symptom onset (Bray; Ebola virus disease Information).
