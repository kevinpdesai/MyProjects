Throughout the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa, there have been reports of voluntary and government-ordered isolation and quarantine.  The use of these terms has led to significant fear due to misconceptions about the terms Quarantine and Isolation, and what this means in relation to infection with the Ebola virus. Quarantine is the separation and restriction of movement of healthy people, who may have been exposed to an infected person. The duration of Quarantine is generally the length of the disease’s incubation period, taking into consideration the individual’s suspected time of exposure. This is different from Isolation, which is the separation and restriction of movement of already infected individuals. Quarantines allow health authorities to prevent further spread of a disease in the event the quarantined individual develops clinical symptoms of the disease of concern.  Quarantine is just a precautionary measure, preventing possibly sick individuals from infecting others (therefore breaking the line of transmission).  Quarantined individuals often turn out to not have the disease, but the risk of spread within a community is so great that health authorities deem it appropriate to watch over the individuals until they know they are uninfected.
