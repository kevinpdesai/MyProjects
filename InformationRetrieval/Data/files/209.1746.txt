The lack of treatments in the most-affected regions has spurred controversy. Some individuals are demanding that experimental drugs be made more widely available in Africa on a humanitarian basis. Other individuals warn that making unproven drugs widely available would be unethical, especially in light of past experimentation conducted in developing countries by Western drug companies. As a result of the controversy, on August 12, 2014 an expert panel of the WHO endorsed the use of interventions with as-yet-unknown effects for both treatment and prevention of EVD. The WHO expert panel also stated that deciding which treatments should be used and how to distribute them equitably were matters that needed further discussion.
