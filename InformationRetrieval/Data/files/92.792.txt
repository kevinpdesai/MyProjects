The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS)-led research, published in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, describes the use of fecal samples from wild great apes to identify populations likely to have been exposed to the virus. This represents a new tool for performing large, population-scale field assessments that can potentially change the way Ebola virus is studied and improve our understanding of the virus’ distribution in space and time—a matter of great importance to both the human health and conservation communities.
