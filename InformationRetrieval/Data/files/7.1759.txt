Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers are caused by related but different strains of Salmonella spp. There is considerable overlap in symptoms, although typhoid is the more severe and long-lasting disease, and is the one more likely to result in death if prompt treatment is not given. The name typhoid means 'resembling typhus', and was chosen because of the occurrence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in all three diseases. However, although there can be some symptom overlap, typhus, and the related condition scrub typhus, are completely separate diseases.Typhoid feverIs caused by a Gram-negative organism Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi (Salmonella typhi).NEW - log your activity Add notes to any clinical page and create a reflective diary Automatically track and log every page you have viewed Print and export a summary to use in your appraisalClick to find out more Â»Paratyphoid feverIs divided into three subtypes (A, B and C). Paratyphoid fever is caused by any of three serovars of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica:S. paratyphi A.S. schottmuelleri (also called S. paratyphi B).S. hirschfeldii (also called S. paratyphi C).Type A is the most common worldwide, although B predominates in Europe. Type C is rare, and is seen only in the Far East.[1][2][3]The overall ratio of disease caused by S. typhi to that caused by S. paratyphi is about 10 to 1.[4]
