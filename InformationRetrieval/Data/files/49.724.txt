The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria is composed of two distinct regions, a hydrophilic polar region, the polysaccharide (PS) [consisting of the O-antigen PS (O-PS) and the core-PS], and a hydrophobic lipid portion, lipid-A [1], [2] and [3]. All Gram-negative bacteria generally possess distinct surface layers such as the outer membrane, the inner or the cytoplasmic membrane and the peptidoglycan. Lipid-A region of the LPS is anchored to the outer leaflet of the outer membrane and the core-PS and O-PS regions project outward. The outer membrane contains both proteins and LPSs and these components interact with the host to elicit the antibacterial immune response.
