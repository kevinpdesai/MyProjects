However, if the new findings are scientifically verified then the 21 day quarantine periods are simply not long enough. With only 5% or 12% of Ebola patients going beyond 21 days it may not seem like a large concern to many. But we must remember that Ebola is a death sentence for over half of those who contract it. This means that a quarantine period that is too short may allow just one person, or maybe a handful of people, to be cleared while still carrying the virus. Just one person can turn into multiple cases that can then grow exponentially. It seems that there are many who are rolling the dice, in regards to our safety, and hoping they are right. They are playing a dangerous game of chance with public health and this is not acceptable. When these new studies emerge, from seemingly credible sources I must add, there needs to be an immediate investigation into the new facts and, if needed, policies should be revisited. That does not appear to be happening. I expect these 21-day quarantines to be standard for quite some time.
