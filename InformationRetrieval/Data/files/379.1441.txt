Typhus fever has a different presentation than common salmonellosis. Initial symptoms typically include sustained fever, anorexia, lethargy, malaise, dull continuous headache and non-productive cough. Vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent, but constipation is frequently reported. During the second week of illness, there is often a protracted fever and mental dullness, which is how the disease got the name “typhoid,” which means “stupor-like.” After the first week or so, many cases develop a maculopapular rash on the trunk and upper abdomen. Other symptoms can include intestinal bleeding, slight deafness and parotitis. Mild and atypical infections are common, but as many as 10–20% of untreated infections may be fatal (the case-fatality rate is <1% with prompt antibiotic treatment). Relapses are not uncommon.
