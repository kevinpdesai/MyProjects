The therapeutics include also the dietetics, and in cholera infantum it becomes very important to see to it that the proper nourishment is given to the children. The better the dietetics of a child have been understood, and the more proper the nourishment has been from its birth, the less liable will it be to be attacked violently by the ordinary diseases of children during the hot weather. There are general dietetic rules for the children laid down in the books, and its all well to know them, but they lend to generalizations ; each individual child wants its individual diet, adapted to its individual constitutional condition. The administration of crude substances supposed to be wanting in the organism is based on "materialism", the substances so wanting, or supposed to be wanting, can at best only be supplied by food containing them only in a greater proportion than its ordinary nourishment did. The instinct of children will very frequently indicate the requisite nourishment which then should never be withheld, even if it is contrary to speculative science. In properly nourished children we will rarely ever find a bad case of cholera infantum, and the more we have studied carefully the proper diet of each individual child under our care, the less will they be liable to diseases of the digestive organs. Many cases of children come under the treatment of the physician which he has never seen before, and the more general experience he has gained about the proper diet of the children, the easier will he be able to detect what mistakes have been made in each individual case, and he will at once endeavor to correct the erroneous diet.
