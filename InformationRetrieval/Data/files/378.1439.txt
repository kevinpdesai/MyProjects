During about the second week of fever, when typhoid bacilli are present in great numbers in the bloodstream, a rash of small, rose-coloured spots appears on the trunk, lasts four or five days, and then fades away. The lymph follicles (Peyer patches) along the intestinal wall in which the typhoid bacilli have multiplied become inflamed and necrotic and may slough off, leaving ulcers in the walls of the intestine. The dead fragments of intestinal tissue may erode blood vessels, causing hemorrhage, or they may perforate the intestinal wall, allowing the intestineâ€™s contents to enter the peritoneal cavity (peritonitis). Other complications can include acute inflammation of the gallbladder, heart failure, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, encephalitis, and meningitis. With a continued high fever the symptoms usually increase in intensity, and mental confusion and delirium may appear.
