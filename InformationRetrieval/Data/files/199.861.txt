Most U.S. patients have received blood or plasma transfusions from an Ebola survivor who's developed antibodies to the disease, in the belief that it may help boost the patient's ability to fight the virus. Dr. Kent Brantly, one of the first two American aid workers to survive, has donated his blood several times. While still in Liberia, Brantly himself received a blood transfusion from a young patient of his who'd survived.
