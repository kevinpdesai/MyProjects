Cholera is an infection of the intestine by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Symptoms may range from none, to mild, to severe.[ 1] The classic symptom is large amounts of watery diarrhea that lasts a few days.[ 2] Vomiting and muscle cramps may also occur.[ 1] Diarrhea can be so severe that it leads within hours to severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.[ 2] This may result in sunken eyes, cold skin, decreased skin elasticity, and wrinkling of the hands and feet.[ 3] The dehydration may result in the skin turning bluish.[ 4] Symptoms start two hours to five days after exposure.
