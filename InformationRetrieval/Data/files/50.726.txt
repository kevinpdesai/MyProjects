Cholera is endemic in the Middle East, Africa, Central and South America, parts
of Asia and the Gulf Coast of the United States but outbreaks can occur in any
country. Major epidemics occur periodically in less developed countries; outbreaks in
developed countries are usually localized due to better sanitation.
