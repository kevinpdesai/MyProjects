There are several medications available to treat malaria, including
chloroquine (Aralen Phosphate),
atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone),
artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem),
mefloquine (Lariam),
quinine (Qualaquin),
quinidine (Quinaglute Dura-Tabs, Quinidex Extentabs, Quin-Release),
doxycycline (Adoxa, Alodox, Avidoxy, Doryx, Monodox, Oracea, Oraxyl, Periostat, Vibramycin, Vibramycin Calcium, Vibramycin Monohydrate, Vibra-Tabs, used in combination with quinine),
clindamycin (Cleocin HCl, Cleocin Pediatric, used in combination with quinine),
artesunate (available only through the CDC).
The choice of drug depends on the species of Plasmodium and the risk of drug resistance in the area where the malaria was acquired. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, older drugs like chloroquine are largely ineffective.
