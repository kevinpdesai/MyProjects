Overall, 49 people were admitted to Makokou General Hospital with suspected HF between December 1994 and February 1995 during these two waves. 29 of the 49 patients had fatal cases of EHF (case fatality rate of 59%). 26 of the EHF patients were male and 23 were female. The mean age of the patients was 37. Whether the number of infected people reflects the true number of EHF cases during this epidemic is not known. Some of the patients who were admitted with suspected EHF could have had a different type of HF or a different disease all together. Some cases who did have EHF could have sought the care of a nganga without seeking hospital care or could have died in their village or in the bush without the EHF investigative team being informed.
