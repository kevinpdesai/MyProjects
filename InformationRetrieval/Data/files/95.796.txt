Plasmodium vivax or relapsing malaria is the most prevalent species in Southeast Asia and South America. P. vivax has the ability to become dormant in the liver, and may reactivate after several months leading to an attack of malaria in the absence of a mosquito bite. Current therapy is with primaquine, which must be taken over 14 days. In patients with a G6PD deficiency, primaquine causes haemolysis. MMV is actively looking for new molecules that provide a radical cure for vivax malaria and will therefore put an end to the relapse.
