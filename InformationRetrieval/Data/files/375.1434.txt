Anywhere from one week to one month after Salmonella typhi is ingested, it invades the intestines, multiplies, and spreads into the bloodstream. The bacteria can then spread to the spleen and liver, where they multiply even more, re-entering the bloodstream, causing illness and spreading to the gall bladder and back to the intestine, where severe damage to the intestines occurs.
