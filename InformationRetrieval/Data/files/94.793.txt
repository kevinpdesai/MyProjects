Protective measures against the mosquito have been used for hundreds of years. The inhabitants of swampy regions in ancient Egypt were known to sleep in tower-like structures out of the reach of mosquitoes; others slept under nets. Current measures that protect against infection are still mosquito-focused, like protective clothing, repellents, bed nets, or mosquito control programs. Studies in Ghana, Kenya, and other African nations show that about 30 percent of child deaths could be avoided if children slept under bed nets regularly treated with insecticides.
