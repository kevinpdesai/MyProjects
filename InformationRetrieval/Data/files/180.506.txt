One of the most interesting ghU topics this semester included a discussion about the single-payer health care system. Brendan started by explaining the basics of the single-payer system to the large group, and then we analyzed the specifics of this policy and discussed it in comparison to President Obamaâ€™s current health care plan. This ghU was very effective because it connected to the Article 25 event that our GlobeMed chapter participated in at the Boston Commons. During this event, we partnered with organizations that are advocating for single-payer health care, and so this ghU session allowed us to better understand their plan. By connecting directly to an advocacy event, the single-payer ghU was extremely informative and well-received by the whole group.
