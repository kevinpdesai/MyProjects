According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of cholera cases reported globally each year is assumed to be a marked underestimate of the actual number of cases that occur. Cholera is underreported for a number of reasons, including the following
Many individuals infected with cholera are unable to seek or access health care.
Cholera is often not differentiated from other diarrheal diseases.
Not all diagnosed cases are reported to public health or health ministry officials.
Not all countries collect and report cholera incidence publicly.
