In its most severe forms, cholera is one of the most rapidly fatal illnesses known if no treatment is provided: A healthy person may become hypotensive within an hour of the onset of symptoms and may die within 2-3 hours. More commonly, however, without rehydration treatment, which is the most common treatment method, the disease progresses from the first liquid stool to shock in 4-12 hours, with death following in 18 hours to several days.[2] Fortunately, the cholera disease is treatable. In general, patients must receive as much fluid as they lose, which can be up to twenty liters, due to diarrhea.
