 Doctors are trying several experimental treatments on patients. Some doctors are giving patients blood transfusions from those who have survived Ebola. The hope is that the survivor's antibodies will help the recipient's immune system fight off the virus. A 1995 study published in the Journal of Infectious Disease found that this treatment may be helpful to reduce the number of deaths from EDV.
