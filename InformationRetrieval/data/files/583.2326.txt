A few treatments have certainly shown promise. Patients who were given the experimental drug ZMapp, which did exceptionally well in animal trials, showed an immediate improvement; however, two of the seven recipients eventually died.

But until a medical breakthrough is made, the keys to fighting Ebola — on both sides of the Atlantic — are resources and manpower. "You need the four S's," says Paul Farmer, co-founder of the aid group Partners in Health: "Staff, stuff, space, systems."
