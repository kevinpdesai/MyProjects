The laboratory diagnosis of cholera is made by isolating V. cholerae O1 or O139 in a proper medium. The TCBS medium is one the most commonly used, enrichment medium is advised for handling environmental samples. Characteristic tiny yellow colonies are observed on the surface of the TCBS medium after within 48 hours of incubation. Specific tests for detecting the serotype and biotype of O1 V. cholerae are recommended. Detection of V. cholerae in a single tube reaction by using a quadruplex PCR that identifies simultaneously the serotype, biotype, toxigenic potential and virulence genes may allow early diagnosis (56). More sensitive methods than available PCR tests have been designed more recently. One of them, loop-mediated isothermal amplification detects cholera toxin producing V. cholerae in 35 minutes using culture samples or 70 minutes using direct stool samples from patients (106).
