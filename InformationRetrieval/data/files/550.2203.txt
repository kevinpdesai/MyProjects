Although some people will display symptoms only a few days after their initial exposure to the Ebola virus, this isn’t always the case. In some instances, it can take as long as 21 days for infected people to begin displaying any kind of symptom. That said, people with Ebola are not typically considered contagious until the onset of symptoms. Researchers currently have little information about why some people have symptoms after two days and others take nearly three weeks to get sick.
