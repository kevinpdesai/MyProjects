The malaria incubation period is defined as the time
elapsed between exposure to the infectious agent
(through the bite of the Anopheles mosquito) and the
manifestation of the first clinical sign or symptom.
Usually, these periods vary depending on the species of
Plasmodium causing malaria. The average incubation
period is 9-14 days for Plasmodium falciparum, 12-17
days for infections by Plasmodium vivax and 18-40 days
for infections caused by Plasmodium malariae
