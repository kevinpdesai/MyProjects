Clouding the debate is the existence of three important time frames. Ebola’s incubation period is the gap between exposure to the virus and the onset of symptoms — typically stated as two to 21 days, but with some evidence it could be longer. Three weeks is typically how long people believed to be exposed to Ebola are kept in quarantine and monitored for symptoms. Then there’s the time a country must go without a new case of Ebola before WHO declares it Ebola-free: 42 days.
