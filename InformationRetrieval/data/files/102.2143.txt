TKM-Ebola was administered to Dr. Rick Sacra, an American who caught Ebola when he was working in a maternity ward in Monrovia, Liberia. The drug is made by Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corporation, and works by blocking genes that help the virus reproduce and spread. Its Phase I clinical trial was halted in July after some participants displayed flu-like side effects. It is said to be in limited supply, but its manufacturer has announced that it created a new form of the treatment to be ready by December. It is unknown how many doses the company will make.
