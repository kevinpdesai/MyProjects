The signs and symptoms of cholera are caused by cholera toxin (CT), a protein enterotoxin that elicits profuse diarrhea. CT activates cyclic adenosine monophosphate, leading to increased Cl- secretion and decreased NaCl-coupled absorption. Glucose, potassium, and bicarbonate absorption, however, remain intact, as does glucose-linked enhancement of sodium and water absorption. Thus, although plain salt water is nonabsorbable during cholera and aggravates the diarrhea, the addition of glucose renders the solution absorbable, providing a physiologic basis for oral rehydration
