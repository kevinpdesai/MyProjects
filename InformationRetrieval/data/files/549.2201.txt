Gastrointestinal symptoms were a prominent feature of this outbreak.
Usually starting towards the end of the first week but occasionally as early as the second or third day patients commonly developed gastrointestinal symptoms. The most frequent was diarrhoea which occurred in 81% of cases. It began abruptly and lasted for about seven days in those who survived. Vomiting occurred less frequently (in 59%), starting after the onset of diarrhoea.
