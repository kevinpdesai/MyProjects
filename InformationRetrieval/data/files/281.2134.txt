Nevertheless, it is useful to consider what was present in the transfused blood that might have been helpful. It is questionable whether antibodies would have had much effect (see below), but the activated allogeneic lymphocytes and the added volume of platelets, erythrocytes, and plasma were probably beneficial. If therapeutic studies are undertaken in patients in the future, it will be important to have randomized control serial laboratory samples and some consideration given to the potential immunostimulatory effects of allogeneic lymphocytes.
