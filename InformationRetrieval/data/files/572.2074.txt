The Ebola virus disease outbreak now ravaging parts of West Africa is the largest on record. In fact, West Africa has seen more cases of the disease in 2014 than have been seen in all other outbreaks combined. The appearance in West Africa of Zaire ebolavirus was initially reported in March 2014, in a rural area of Guinea close to its borders with Sierra Leone and Liberia. Subsequent sequencing analyses from cases in Guinea and Sierra Leone indicate that the virus emerged in December 2013, likely from a single zoonotic introduction in a young child in Guéckédou, Guinea. From that first case of Ebola virus disease, the virus has spread to five countries (Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria, and Senegal), causing 4293 suspected and confirmed cases and claiming 2296 lives (as of September 6, 2014). Prior to 2014, the largest outbreak of Ebola virus disease on record, caused by Sudan ebolavirus, resulted in 425 cases and 224 deaths in Uganda.
