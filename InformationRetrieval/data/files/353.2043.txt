2014-2015 outbreak in West Africa — Although all previous Ebola outbreaks occurred in Central Africa, an epidemic began in the West African nation of Guinea in late 2013 and was confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2014 [12,13]. The initial case was a two-year-old child who developed fever, vomiting, and black stools, without other evidence of hemorrhage [12]. The outbreak subsequently spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Senegal, and Mali [37-39]. Sequence analysis of viruses isolated from patients in Sierra Leone indicated that the epidemic resulted from sustained person-to-person transmission, without additional introductions from animal reservoirs [40].
