ZMapp is a cocktail of antibodies designed to fight Ebola.
A company called Kentucky BioProcessing grows ZMapp's antibodies in tobacco plants. The U.S. government worked with Mapp Biotherapeutics to speed up the process and has signed agreements with other companies to help grow the engineered monoclonal antibodies in other ways. There's enough now to start a clinical trial in Africa. The first U.S. Ebola patient, medical missionary Dr. Kent Brantly, was given a course of ZMapp.
