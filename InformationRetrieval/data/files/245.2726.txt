The Ebola virus disease originally appeared on the world stage in 1976 when not one, but two simultaneous outbreaks hit two different areas in Africa. Over the next three and a half decades around 2000 people were killed by this deadly virus. Now, if you have been watching the news lately you know that a new Ebola outbreak is currently ravaging West Africa. Even with a lower mortality rate of only about 60% compared to as high as 90% in previous outbreaks, over 2500 people have already lost their lives, making this the deadliest Ebola virus outbreak in world history. Three American hospitals, located in New York City, have had to isolate and test potential Ebola cases already with the most recent case at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. All patients presented with early Ebola-like symptoms and several had recently traveled in West Africa. Fortunately, according to the New York Times, none of these individuals tested positive for the virus.
