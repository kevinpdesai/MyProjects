Most people don’t deviate from that two to 21 day incubation period, as this study shows, and many don’t see a doctor before symptoms arise, making a 21 day isolation sufficient for most. But with this current Ebola outbreak, which has claimed more than 4,000 lives and which has an increasing number of people being quarantined before symptoms arise, one way to get ahead of this virus may be by setting a longer quarantine period, so those who survive it may not spread it to others toward the end of the incubation period, Haas suggested in the study.
