Diagnosis and Treatment. Diagnosis of epidemic typhus is based on detection of specific antibodies in patient sera. The use of clinical and epidemiological data is necessary to distinguish among classic typhus, Brill-Zinsser disease, and sylvatic typhus. Doxycycline is highly effective for treatment of typhus. Epidemic typhus also responds well to treatment with tetracycline or chloramphenicol antibiotics.
