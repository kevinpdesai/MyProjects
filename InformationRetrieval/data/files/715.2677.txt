Ebola is a virus that kills as many as 90 percent of those it infects. It is transmitted to humans from wild animals and spreads through contact with infected bodily fluids or organs.
The virus, first identified in 1976, is most common in Central and West Africa. The biggest Ebola outbreak in history erupted in early 2014 and was still spreading as of July 2014.
