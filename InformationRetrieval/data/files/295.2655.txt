These abnormalities, listed by organ system, may include the following:
Renal - Azotemia/proteinuria
Hematologic
Leukopenia (common in the early stages of disease)
WBC count normal/mildly elevated later
Thrombocytopenia
Hepatic - Mild transaminase elevations
Metabolic - Hypoalbuminemia/electrolyte abnormalities (particularly hyponatremia)
