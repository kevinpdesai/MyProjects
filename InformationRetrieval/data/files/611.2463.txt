The key to preventing this disease is to prevent humans from coming into contact with fleas. Pets must be treated at regular intervals with appropriate flea control products. Both cats and dogs can be hosts for the fleas that carry flea-borne typhus. Do not feed wildlife or leave pet food out overnight. Residents are urged to apply flea control products to any animals that they are feeding regularly including free-roaming and/or neighborhood cats to prevent flea infestations.
