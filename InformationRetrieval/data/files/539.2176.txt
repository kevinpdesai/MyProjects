In Indonesia, malaria is resistant to traditional treatment such as chloroquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine. Since 2004, ACT (Artemisin Combination Therapy) has been a standard treatment for malaria in Indonesia. The relatively higher cost of Artemisin Combination Therapies (ACTs) makes a laboratory diagnosis of malaria more cost effective than empiric therapy.
