Rickettsial disease encompasses a group of diseases caused by the microorganisms rickettsiae.
Rickettsiae occupy a position between bacteria and viruses. They can only survive inside cells. Rickettsial diseases vary considerably in severity from self-limiting mild illnesses to severe life-threatening infections, particularly if complications arise. The organisms cause disease by damaging blood vessels in various tissues and organs. In severe cases multiple tissues and organs are affected.
