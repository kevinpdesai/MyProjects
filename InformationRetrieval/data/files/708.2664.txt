How does cholera affect the body?
Cholera is an infection of the small intestine caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae.
Cholera is characterized by watery diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, all of which quickly lead to severe dehydration and, if not treated, death, according to the Mayo Clinic. With near-immediate effects on the body including irritability, sunken eyes, dry mouth, severe thirst, low blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat, dehydration can occur within just hours of the initial onset of cholera symptoms
