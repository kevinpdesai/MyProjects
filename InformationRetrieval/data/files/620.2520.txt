In severe cases, pulse rate increases; BP drops; and delirium, stupor, and muscular twitching develop. Splenomegaly may be present, and interstitial myocarditis is more common than in other rickettsial diseases. In untreated patients, high fever may persist = 2 wk, then falls gradually over several days. With therapy, defervescence usually begins within 36 h. Recovery is prompt and uneventful.
