If symptoms of cholera occur, the main symptom is watery diarrhea, which can be severe enough to rapidly drain the body of vital water, salts, and minerals. The first watery stool appears 1 to 3 days after infection, and from then on the body can lose up to one litre of liquid an hour. Vomiting may appear at the same time.
