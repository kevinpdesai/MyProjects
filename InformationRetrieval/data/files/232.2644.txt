In falciparum malaria, fluid can accumulate in the lungs and cause severe breathing problems. Damage to internal organs can cause blood pressure to fall. Other symptoms of falciparum malaria include diarrhea, jaundice, and kidney failure. The level of sugar (glucose) in the blood can fall. The level may become life-threateningly low in people who have a large number of parasites in their blood, particularly if they are treated with quinine.
