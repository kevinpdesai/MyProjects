On 21 March, the Institut Pasteur in Lyon, France, a WHO Collaborating Centre, confirmed that the causative agent was a filovirus, narrowing the diagnosis down to either Ebola virus disease or Marburg haemorrhagic fever.
The next day, the laboratory confirmed that the causative agent was the Zaire species, the most lethal virus in the Ebola family. That same day, the government alerted WHO to what was described as a “rapidly evolving” outbreak of Ebola virus disease. When WHO publicly announced the outbreak on its website on 23 March, 49 cases and 29 deaths were officially reported.
