Symptoms of Cholera
The symptoms usually appear suddenly due to a very short incubation period and become sever right away. Common symptoms are:
Sever diarrhea and vomiting, which can be very frequent and profuse causing rapid dehydration. The severity of dehydration weakens the patient and can lead even to death. If cholera outbreaks as epidemic, the death rate can be quite high.
In many cases, food or water is vomited out as soon as it reaches the stomach.
