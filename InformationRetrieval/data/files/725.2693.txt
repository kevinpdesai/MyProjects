Scrub typhus involves multiple organs and is characterized by microangiopathies - focal vasculitis or perivasculitis. [1] Pulmonary involvement is a well-documented complication of scrub typhus infection with pleural effusion being a common radiographic feature in 12-55% of patients in previous studies. [1],[2],[30] Other pulmonary manifestations include varying degrees of bronchitis/interstitial pneumonitis progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome, [9] pneumonitis with patchy consolidation, cardiomegaly, pulmonary oedema, hilar adenopathy, focal atelectasis, reticulonodular opacities, bronchial wall thickening, and centrilobular nodules. [1],[2] Radiologic findings may be of value in differentiating scrub typhus from other febrile diseases. The incidence of CXR abnormalities in patients with scrub typhus varied from 59.4 to 78%. [1],[2],[3],[31] In their study, Wu et al., [32] found that the incidence of CXR abnormalities was higher in the older age groups and that the CXR patterns could be different at different stages of the same disease. Patients with abnormal CXR findings had a higher rate of serious complications (such as septic shock, congestive heart failure (CHF), acute respiratory failure, severe jaundice and acute renal failure, and requirement for ICU care and prolonged length of hospital stay) compared with patients with negative CXR results
