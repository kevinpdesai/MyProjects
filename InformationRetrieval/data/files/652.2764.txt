Recovered patients can leave as soon as they have two negative Ebola tests, which typically is around three weeks from the onset of illness, and should have no restriction on contact with others.  The only restriction is for male patients around sexual activity (see answer to the question below). However, because of questions about immunity, there is no formal recommendation at this time for them to work in treatment centers or other venues where protection would be a benefit, such as orphanages housing children whose parents have died, and who are still under observation. This may change as more information is gathered. Itâ€™s also important to note that patients sometimes take months to recover their full strength.
