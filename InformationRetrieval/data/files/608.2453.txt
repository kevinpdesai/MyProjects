Depending on the level of risk, it may be appropriate to recommend no specific interventions, mosquito avoidance measures only, or mosquito avoidance measures plus chemoprophylaxis. For areas of intense transmission, such as West Africa, exposure for even short periods of time can result in transmission, so travelers to this area should be considered at high risk for infection. Malaria transmission is not distributed homogeneously throughout all countries. Some destinations have malaria transmission occurring only in certain areas. If travelers are going to the high-transmission areas during peak transmission times, even though the country as a whole may have lower amounts of malaria transmission, they may be at high risk for infection while there.
