Symptoms
Patients with bacterial dysentery often have fever, abdominal cramps, rectal pain, and bloody stools. Occasionally, large portions of the intestinal membrane pass with particularly foul-smelling stool containing yellowish white mucus and/or blood. In nearly half the cases, Shigella does not cause bloody diarrhea.
