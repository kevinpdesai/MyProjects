Once a person has contracted the Ebola virus, it can take up to 21 days to become symptomatic. The disease causes flu-like symptoms including aches, abdominal pain, fever, vomiting and diarrhea. This leads to dehydration, failure of the liver and kidneys, and hemorrhaging. Some patients may even go into “cytokine storm” in which the immune response is unregulated and an excessive amount of cytokine and immune cells damage tissues and organs, with potentially fatal results. However, there are many diseases that can cause these symptoms, so blood tests need to be done to rule out things like malaria, hepatitis, cholera, meningitis, and others.
