The diagnosis is usually confirmed serologically after a course of empiric therapy with a tetracycline or chloramphenicol. Although rickettsial cultures of blood, skin biopsy with direct fluorescent antibody staining, and polymerase chain reaction have been used to diagnose murine typhus, the mainstay of diagnosis is the indirect fluorescent antibody test. This test is available through all state health department laboratories. A diagnosis of murine typhus can be established by a fourfold antibody titer rise between acute and convalescent serum samples.
