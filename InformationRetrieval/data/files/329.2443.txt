WH: First things first. How is Ebola spread? Dr. Basler: All the available information is that it spreads from person to person through contact with bodily fluids from an infected individual. It doesn’t seem to spread by being in close proximity, or by casual contact. The recommendations are that you avoid contact with infected individuals’ blood, feces, or other bodily fluids.
