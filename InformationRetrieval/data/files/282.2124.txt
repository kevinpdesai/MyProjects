 Brincidofovir is another experimental treatment for EDV. This oral drug prevents the virus from replicating itself. Brincidofovir is currently under development and has not been tested on humans. It is in Phase 3 clinical testing, according to the drug's maker, Chimerix. Phase 3 testing means it has been given to large groups of people to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments and collect information that will allow the treatment to be used safely, according to the National Institutes of Health.
