When the tests of the third set of specimens proved to be negative the patient was discharged home. In view of previous experience in Germany with Marburg virus(16), a sample of semen was taken on day 39 and found to contain 3-10 guinea-pig infective units/ml. However this discovery was not thought to justify further isolation, especially as the patient fully appreciated the implications. Semen was positive again on day 61 but negative on days 76, 92 and 110.
