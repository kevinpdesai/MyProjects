Louse-borne typhus (also known as epidemic or classic typhus) occurs after feces of an infected louse are rubbed into a break in the skin. After an incubation period of 6 to 15days, the symptoms begin to appear: headache, running of the nose, cough, nausea, and chest pain. These are followed in a few days by high fever and chills, vomiting,constipation or diarrhea, muscular aching, and perhaps delirium or stupor. A red rash, which may bleed, appears on the trunk and spreads to the arms and legs. After about 2weeks the symptoms usually subside. Ordinarily louse-borne typhus is not fatal, but it can be, particularly if pneumonia develops or if the afflicted person has heart disease.Its alternative name epidemic typhus comes from the devastation it has caused throughout history. It tends to appear where people are crowded together and are weakened bycold, disease, or starvation. It has many colloquial names, such as war fever, camp fever, and jail fever.
