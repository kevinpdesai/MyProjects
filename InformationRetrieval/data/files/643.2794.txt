Most cases are mild and subside within 7 days (60-70%).  Some last for 2 weeks (20-30%) and a few persist longer (5-10%). In one third to one half of patients, initial symptoms include periumbilical cramping, intense abdominal pain that mimics appendicitis, malaise, myalgias, headache, and vomiting.
