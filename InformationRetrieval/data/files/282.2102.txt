 Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a rare and often-fatal infection caused by one of the five strains of the Ebola virus. Ebola first appeared in 1976 in a simultaneous outbreak in the areas that are now Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Since then, there have been sporadic outbreaks in Africa.
