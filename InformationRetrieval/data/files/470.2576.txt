Other areas, such as Central Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and parts of Latin America and the Caribbean have varying levels of malaria transmission, although rarely reaching hyper- or holoendemic levels. These areas also have varying ratios of P. falciparum and non-falciparum, although many areas outside sub-Saharan Africa have higher percentages of non-falciparum malaria, particularly P. vivax.
