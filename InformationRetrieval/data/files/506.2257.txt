A recognized way of estimating the number of parasites present in 1 μl of blood is to use a standard value for the WBC count (8,000 WBC/μl). Counting the number of parasites present until 200 WBC have been seen and then multiplying the parasites counted by 40 will give the parasite count per microliter of blood. If an accurate WBC count is known, this can be used to give a more accurate figure with appropriate adjustment of the multiplication factor.
