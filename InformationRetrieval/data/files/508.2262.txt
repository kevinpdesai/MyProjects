The mainstay of scrub typhus diagnosis and of epidemiology studies is serologic testing. The gold standard assay for the serologic detection of scrub typhus antibodies is the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) [14, 15]; however, other tests, such as the indirect immunoperoxidase and Weil-Felix assays, are also used. The IFA was first described in 1963 by Bozeman et al. [12] and has subsequently been modified to allow the use of smaller volumes of serum and antigens [16, 17]. The IFA uses epifluorescence to visualize a fluorescein-linked anti-human antibody conjugate to detect the presence of scrub typhus-specific antibody bound to smears of scrub typhus antigen [12]. However, there is little consensus apparent in the choice of IFA methodology (i.e., antigenic strains and antibody isotype) and of the positivity cutoff limits for diagnostic and epidemiologic purposes. From a diagnostic standpoint, this lack of consensus raises a number of questions: (1) What is the most appropriate IFA methodology in a given setting? (2) What is the most appropriate positive cutoff titer to make an accurate diagnosis? (3) And how does one determine appropriate positivity cutoff limits for seroepidemiology studies in a setting of endemicity? Here, we present the findings of an extensive review of scrub typhus IFA methodologies and diagnostic criteria used in previously published diagnostic and seroprevalence studies, describing the nature of methodological variations and determining the strength of evidence for the application of seropositivity cutoff values.
