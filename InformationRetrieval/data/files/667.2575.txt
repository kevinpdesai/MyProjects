Clinicians who treat malaria in the United States are sometimes asked, "Is it contagious?" The answer is that malaria is not spread directly from person to person. A few cases have occurred in other countries through blood transfusion, intravenous drug abuse with shared needles, or organ transplantation. An infected mother can spread malaria through the placenta to her unborn child. Except for these rare situations, transmission occurs when a person is bitten by an infected mosquito and is not contagious to other individuals.
