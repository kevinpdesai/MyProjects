The rate at which cases give rise to subsequent cases, which epidemiologists call R0, is the key variable in the spread of Ebola. For easily transmitted diseases R0 can be high; for measles it is 18. Ebola is much harder to catch: estimates of R0 in different parts of the outbreak range from 1.5 to 2.2. Any R0 above 1 is bad news. The very high mortality rate of the disease, estimated at around 60% in this outbreak, means that Ebola can quickly claim more lives than other, more established killers.
