All rickettsial diseases should be treated with antibiotic therapy. They should be started early in the first week of illness to be most effective and to produce a good outcome. Doxycycline is the drug of choice. Chloramphenicol may be used as an alternative. Supportive therapy with electrolyte and fluid maintenance are also essential to the management of patients with rickettsial diseases, particularly if there are signs of low blood pressure, electrolyte disturbances, and blood coagulation (clotting) problems (DIC).
