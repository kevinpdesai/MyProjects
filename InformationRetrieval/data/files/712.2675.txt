The Ebola virus is systematic meaning it affects every single organ and tissue in the body. This means that no matter where the virus enters — the respiratory system, the central nervous system, what have you — it will spread out to eventually infect the entire body with the exception of bones and skeletal muscles. Other systemic viruses include mumps, measles, chicken pox and shingles.
