October 15, 2014 – A second healthcare worker who provided care for the index patient at Texas Presbyterian Hospital tested positive for Ebola.
This second healthcare worker was transferred to Emory Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia.
The healthcare worker had traveled by air from Dallas to Cleveland on October 10 and from Cleveland to Dallas on October 13. CDC worked to ensure that all passengers and crew on the two flights were contacted by public health professionals to answer their questions and arrange follow up as necessary.
The patient has since recovered and was discharged on October 28.
By November 3, all passengers on both flights completed the 21-day monitoring period.
