This infection, caused by Plasmodium falciparum, is the most dangerous form of malaria and can be fatal. In falciparum malaria, infected red blood cells stick to the walls of small blood vessels and clog them, damaging many organs—particularly the brain (cerebral malaria), lungs, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract.
