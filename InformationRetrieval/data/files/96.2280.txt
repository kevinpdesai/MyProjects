About 100 million bacteria must typically be ingested to cause cholera in a normal healthy adult.[ 11] This dose, however, is less in those with lowered gastric acidity (for instance those using proton pump inhibitors).[ 11] Children are also more susceptible, with two- to four-year-olds having the highest rates of infection.[ 11] Individuals' susceptibility to cholera is also affected by their blood type, with those with type O blood being the most susceptible.[ 11] Persons with lowered immunity, such as persons with AIDS or children who are malnourished, are more likely to experience a severe case if they become infected.[ 15] Any individual, even a healthy adult in middle age, can experience a severe case, and each person's case should be measured by the loss of fluids, preferably in consultation with a professional health care provider.
