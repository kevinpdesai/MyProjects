WHO: The latest update continues to show that the Ebola outbreak has slowed significantly, even though this week's case count (37) is up slightly from last week's (30). All of the new cases were reported from just 8 prefectures/districts in Guinea and Sierra Leone. That's the lowest number in nearly a year. For the third week in a row, Liberia had no new cases. Response indicators from Sierra Leone are favourable. Very few of the suspected cases tested actually had Ebola, and the number of cases diagnosed post-mortem in the community dropped. A mixed picture emerged from Guinea, where fewer than half of all new cases reported were among registered Ebola contacts. (This means more than 50% of the new cases were among people who were not identified as at-risk for the disease, indicating ongoing undetected chains of transmission.)
