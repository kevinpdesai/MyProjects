Although much remains unknown about Ebola, scientists have begun to piece together some of the puzzle. Ebola was first identified in 1976 in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire) and named for a river that flows through that African nation. Part of the filovirus family, Ebola virus has four subtypes, each named for the location in which it was discovered: Ebola-Zaire, Ebola-Sudan, Ebola-Ivory Coast, and Ebola-Reston. The Ebola-Reston virus, first detected in the United States in 1989, was discovered in sick monkeys imported from the Philippines to a research laboratory in Reston, Virginia. Although a few laboratory workers later showed signs of the virus in the blood, none of them became ill.
