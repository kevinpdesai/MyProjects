Apart from taking medical treatment, here are a few things that you can do at home that will provide you with some relief as well as help you recover from malaria faster. Make sure your diet consists mainly of grapefruit, orange juice and other fresh fruits, and raw vegetables. If you want to have boiled vegetables, do not add any spices to it. Fever dehydrates the body to a very large extend. To counter this deficiency, drink lots of fluid, such as fresh fruit juices and water. Do not drink aerated drinks, tea, or coffee. You can, however, have milk.
