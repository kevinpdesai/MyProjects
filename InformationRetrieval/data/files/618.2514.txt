Scrub typhus is a mite-borne infectious disease caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi (previously called Rickettsia tsutsugamushi). This disease was first described by the Chinese in the third century, but the first description of its classic features did not appear in the western literature until the end of the nineteenth century.The incubation period of murine endemic typhus is one to two weeks.
