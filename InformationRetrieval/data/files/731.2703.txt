Cholera is caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which is able to colonise the intestine usually after consumption of contaminated water or food. Once infection is established, the bacterium secretes a toxin that causes watery diarrhea and ultimately death if not treated rapidly.
In the research, the scientists, led by Gavin Thomas, investigated one of the important routes that V cholera uses to gain this foothold. To be able to grow in the intestine thebacterium harvests and then eats a sugar, called sialic acid, that is present on the surface of our gut cells.
