It was MSF who sent the samples taken by WHO and the MOH (Guinea Ministry of Health) to France for diagnostic investigation. So I called Paris and said look, test for Lassa fever but please also test for Marburg and Ebola because of this story about people being infected after funerals and also doctors and nurses being infected. Lassa in the classical setting does not spread like fire. The transmission is less than you would see with Marburg or Ebola.
