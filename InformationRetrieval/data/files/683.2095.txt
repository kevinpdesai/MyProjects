Patients infected with Ebola are given supportive therapy. Fluids are given to replace those lost due to vomiting and diarrhea, medication can be given to lower fever, and the patientâ€™s blood pressure and oxygen are closely monitored. Antibiotics can be given to prevent secondary bacterial infections. Vaccines and treatments for Ebola are being developed and tested, but none have been approved for use.
