Intestinal infection with Vibrio cholerae results in the loss of large volumes of watery stool, leading to severe and
rapidly progressing dehydration and shock. Without adequate and appropriate rehydration therapy, severe cholera kills
about half of affected individuals. Cholera toxin, a potent stimulator of adenylate cyclase, causes the intestine to
secrete watery fluid rich in sodium, bicarbonate, and potassium, in volumes far exceeding the intestinal absorptive
capacity. Cholera has spread from the Indian subcontinent where it is endemic to involve nearly the whole world seven
times during the past 185 years
