That's partly because Ebola patients aren't contagious until they've started exhibiting symptoms such as fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. Someone may be incubating the disease for a week or more without knowing it, potentially putting others at risk. And yet locking up everyone returning to the U.S. from the three Ebola-stricken countries in West Africa seems pointless if they can't pass on the disease anyway.
