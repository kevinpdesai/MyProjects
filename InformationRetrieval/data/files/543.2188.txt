Endemic typhus (mainly caused by R. typhi) is also termed murine typhus and "jail fever". "Endemic typhus" also means that an area or region has an animal population (usually mice, rats, or squirrels) that has members of its population continually infected with R. typhi that through flea vectors can incidentally infect humans.
