Cholera affects an estimated 3–5 million people worldwide and causes 58,000–130,000 deaths a year as of 2010.[ 2] [ 8] While it is currently classified as a pandemic, it is rare in the developed world. Children are being most affected.[ 2] [ 9] Cholera occurs as both outbreaks and chronically in certain areas. Areas with an ongoing risk of disease include Africa and south-east Asia. While the risk of death among those affected is usually less than 5%, it may be as high as 50% among some groups who don't have access to treatment.[ 2] Historical descriptions of cholera are found as early as the 5th century BC in Sanskrit.[ 3] The study of cholera by John Snow between 1849 and 1854 led to significant advances in the field of epidemiology.[ 10] [ 3]
