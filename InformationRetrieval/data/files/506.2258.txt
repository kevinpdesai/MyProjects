The most accurate counts are obtained by counting the total parasites seen in a measured volume of blood. The blood volume should not be less than 2 Î¼l and is spread over an area of 1 cm2. However, this method is time-consuming, and a count of parasites against 200 WBC in a thick film, if an accurate total white count is known, gives satisfactory accuracy for most clinical purposes.
