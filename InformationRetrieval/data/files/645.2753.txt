Once Cholera have attached to the intestine, the incubation period is fairly short from several hours to five days.  Fever does not usually occur with Cholera.  Cholera produces a toxin called choleragen.  “Choleragen is an A-B type toxin composed of 5 B subunits that bind the toxin to the cell, and an A subunit that is injected into the cell. The A subunit is an enzyme with ADP-ribosylating activity. The toxin adds an ADP-ribose from NAD to a regulatory subunit of adenyl cyclase, causing an unregulated synthesis of cAMP” (Duckworth 5).  It is this entertoxin that causes fluid secretion and electrolytes in the small intestine hence the watery diarrhea (8).  Diarrhea with rice water stools is a key diagnostic test for identifying Cholera.  Depending on the severity of the infection, many vital fluids are lost through diarrhea, resulting in rapid dehydration, which can lead to death.  Other symptoms include intense thirst, muscle cramps, weakness, and minimal urine production. Symptoms usually subside between 3 to 6 days and in a couple of weeks most people are free of the disease (7).
