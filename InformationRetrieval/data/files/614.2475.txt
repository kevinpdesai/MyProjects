Cholera outbreaks occur when there is a presence of Vibrio cholerae organisms in areas with significant breeches in water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure. Clean water, or disinfection or boiling water, is the optimal means to prevent transmission. In addition, foods that come from potentially contaminated waters, e.g., crabs, oysters, shellfish and fish, should be cooked thoroughly.
