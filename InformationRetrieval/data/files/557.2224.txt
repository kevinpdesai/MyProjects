The disease begins to manifest itself approximately 10-12 days after the chigger bites. The first symptom is usually a small raised mark at the site of the bite, which later becomes a dried out, blackish spot called an “eschar” (scar). It is most often found near the groin, armpits, neck and in the external genital regions. There may be an associated rash around the eschar, and the lymph nodes near the affected area may become swollen.
