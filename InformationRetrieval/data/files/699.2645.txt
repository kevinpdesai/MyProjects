One particular type of malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, is also able to modify the surface of red blood cells it infects. It causes these cells to become “sticky”, so they lodge in the small blood vessels leading up to major organs. This build-up is called sequestration, and results in reduced blood flow and oxygen deprivation in the organs. When sequestration occurs in the blood vessels in the brain, the patient may experience impaired consciousness, psychological disruption, coma and even death – this manifestation is called “cerebral malaria”.
