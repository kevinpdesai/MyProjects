This new drug, termed ZMapp, was developed by a biotech firm (Mapp Biopharmaceutical, Inc.). Several years ago, this company and the National Institutes of Health and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency were tasked to develop a treatment for Ebola virus infection. The drug consists of an anti-Ebola antibody that is made up of part mouse and part human antibody. The mouse part of the antibody is produced in mice immunized against Ebola virus. The active section of the mouse antibody against Ebola was then placed on the human antibody that was modified to carry the part of the mouse antibody that is effective in limiting or stopping Ebola replication. These chimeric antibodies (one antibody type produced from two different antibodies) were reproduced in Chinese hamster ovary cells and in plant cells that were genetically modified to produce large amounts of chimeric antibodies.
