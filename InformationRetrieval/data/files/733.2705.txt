V. cholerae cells enter the body
and make their way through the digestive system.
Approximately two-thirds survive the acidic
conditions of the stomach; survivors conserve energy
until they enter the small intestine where they
begin production of their flagella. The flagellum,
which is a long tail-like structure, propels each
Vibrio cell forward through the mucus layer to the
intestinal wall. V. cholerae also produces enzymes
that digest the layers of mucus, which helps with
access to the epithelial cells lining the intestine,
as well as detachment from cells that are being
lost due to the body’s defence mechanisms
: For symptoms to persist, the bacteria
must continue to multiply in the intestine
