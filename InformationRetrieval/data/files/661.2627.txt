The exact numbers of those who died at sea is unknown, although Whyte himself estimated it at 5293. During the crossing itself, bodies were thrown into the sea, but once the ships had reached Grosse Isle they were kept in the hold until a burial on land became possible. The dead were dragged out of the holds with hooks and 'stacked like cordwood' on the shore.[ 7] On 29 July 1847 Whyte described 'a continuous line of boats, each carrying its freight of dead to the burial groundâ€¦ Some had several corpses so tied up in canvas that the stiff, sharp outline of death was easily traceable'.[ 3]
