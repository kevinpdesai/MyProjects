For areas where microscopy is not available, or where laboratory staff are not experienced at malaria diagnosis, there are commercial antigen detection tests that require only a drop of blood.[ 8] Immunochromatographic tests (also called: Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Tests, Antigen-Capture Assay or "Dipsticks") have been developed, distributed and field tested. These tests use finger-stick or venous blood, the completed test takes a total of 15â€“20 minutes, and the results are read visually as the presence or absence of colored stripes on the dipstick, so they are suitable for use in the field.
