It had been a fine summer when on the 19th July 1832, Dr Miller of the Exeter Infirmary attended a woman and her two children in North Street, who had suddenly become sick. The woman, who had recently come from Plymouth, exhibited all the symptoms of a disease that the city had long feared and expected, and within a few hours had gained the dubious distinction of being the first victim of the cholera in Exeter, a disease that was sweeping through England. A second case of the cholera in a man recently arrived from London to St Thomas, was attended by Mr Woodman, a physician from St Thomas and accompanied by a young doctor of the name Thomas Shapter who was also from the Infirmary in Friernhay Street.
