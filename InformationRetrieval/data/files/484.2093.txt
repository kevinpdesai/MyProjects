 Ebola virus was first identified in 1976. By the end of that year, two related strains of the virus were known--Ebola Zaire and Ebola Sudan. Three other strains are now known to exist. Vaccine development began in the late 1970s: results from a test of inactivated Ebola vaccine in guinea pigs were published in Lancet in 1980. Because EVD outbreaks are rare and have, until 2014, been controlled quickly, commercial vaccine manufacturers have demonstrated little urgency in advancing vaccines through clinical trials. That changed in 2014: several vaccines previously tested only in animals are being fast-tracked into Phase 1 clinical trials.
