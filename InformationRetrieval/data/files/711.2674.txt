once ebola enters the body, the innate immune system will attempt to combat it, so it initially infect phagocytes. unfortunately, phagocytes cannot lyse the virulent proteins and therefore it uses macrophages, dendritic cells and monocytes (types of phagocytes) as the initial host. within the next 3 days it will migrate throughout the lymph nodes and the blood stream to infect the parenchyma of most organs. the only cells it will not infect is skeletal/cardiac muscle and bone
