Once inside the bloodstream of the bitten individual, the sporozoites home in on the liver. Each sporozoite invades a separate liver cell, and in P. falciparum takes five to seven days to divide and produce thousands of "merozoites," each of which will infect a red blood cell (erythrocyte) when the liver cell bursts. After entering the erythrocyte, the merozoite breaks down the cell's hemoglobin, feeding off the amino acids. The growing parasite, or trophozoite, will eventually become a "shizont" when it begins to divide again to form new merozoites.
