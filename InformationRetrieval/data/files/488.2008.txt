A very sick patient came into Cairns' clinic and died before doctors could offer a diagnosis. This was not particularly extraordinary, given the panoply of exotic infectious diseases native to the region. The local authorities requested an autopsy to see if they couldn’t figure out what killed this person so quickly. During the procedure, Cairns nicked himself with a scalpel, drawing blood. It was that moment that he became, quite possibly, the first non-African Ebola patient — and would become, almost certainly, the first non-African Ebola survivor.
