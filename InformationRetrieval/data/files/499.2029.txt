The hemorrhagic fever from the Ebola virus first occurs in two simultaneous outbreaks in Zaire (now called the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or DRC) and Sudan. In Yambuku, Zaire, it kills 280 people. The disease is first thought to be Marburg virus but is identified later that year as a different, but related disease. It is named after the Ebola River, which is near the outbreak site.
