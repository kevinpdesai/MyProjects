There is as yet no vaccine available to prevent Ebola infection.  The aim of all prevention techniques is to avoid contact with the blood or body fluids of infected persons.  This includes avoiding travel to areas where Ebola outbreaks are occurring, and taking precautions when providing health care for potentially infectious persons.  Precautions may include wearing of protective clothing (such as masks, gloves, gowns, and goggles), using infection-control measures (such as complete equipment sterilization and routine use of disinfectant), and isolating patients with Ebola from contact with unprotected persons.  See CDC guidance on infection control in healthcare settings.
