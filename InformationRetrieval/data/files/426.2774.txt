 Depends which species of the malarial parasite this character is infected with, and that will depend somewhat on from where exactly they are a refuge. Plasmodium vivax is the most common in Asia and the US, whereas P. falciparum is the most common in Africa. For P. vivax the treatment is for about 14 days but there is a problem of drug resistance and relapse with this beast; it can recur throughout life. However it is not usually life threatening. For P. falciparum the treatment is a bit easier and lasts about 3 days, the disease usually does not recur. However this form can be deadly if not treated quickly.
