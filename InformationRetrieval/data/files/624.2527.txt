Malaria can be diagnosed by demonstration of malaria parasites in blood films. Blood samples should be sent to a laboratory with experience in the diagnosis of malaria by the use of thick and thin films. Repeated examination may be necessary due to variations in density of parasites. Confirmation of the species should be sought from a reference laboratory.
