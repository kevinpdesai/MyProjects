It's not enough for a virus to enter the body. It must spread rapidly to become a danger to its host body — and Ebola does. No one knows how the virus enters the first cell, but once it does, it's hard to halt. To replicate rapidly, Ebola creates a protein called "ebolavirus glycoprotein" that weakens any attempt by the immune system to respond adeptly to the invading disease. The protein also increases permeability of blood vessels which allows blood to leak out and the hemorrhaging associated with Ebola to occur.
