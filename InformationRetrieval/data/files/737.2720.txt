The death rate from ebola can be as high as 90 per cent, and around eight in ten people who’ve caught it since it was first identified have died. During an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2003, 143 people caught the virus, and of them 128 died. Another outbreak in the same country in 2007 killed 186 people out of the 264 who caught it.
