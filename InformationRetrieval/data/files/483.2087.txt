Ebola virus disease (EVD) is an acute viral illness that used to be known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever. It is caused by three of the five species within the Ebolavirus genus. Two species are capable of infecting humans, but do not seem to cause illness - so you can catch it, but you won't notice it. The other three can cause variable degrees of illness. Unfortunately, the Zaire Ebola virus is the most deadly strain, and has been identified as the cause of the current outbreak. In previous outbreaks, this strain has had a 90% death rate.
