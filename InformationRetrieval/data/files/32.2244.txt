 The ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test, which can provide results within 15 minutes, is based on detection of the Ebola protein rather than nucleic acid. When compared with the results of a NAT previously listed by WHO and currently being used in the field (RealStarÂ® Filovirus Screen RT-PCR Kit 1.0, altona Diagnostics GmbH), ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test is able to correctly identify about 92% of Ebola infected patients and 85% of those not infected with the virus.
