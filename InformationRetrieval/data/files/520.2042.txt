The outbreak began in December 2013 but ebola was not reported to WHO until March 2014 when a man from remote South-East Guinea went 200 miles to the capital city  Conakry to be treated. Two cases were soon reported in Liberia and control measures went into effect, with apparent efficacy.  However new cases were reported in Sierra Leone in May then in Nigeria in July (the case in Nigeria was brought home by a government offcial from Liberia, and on airplane, knowing himself sick!)
