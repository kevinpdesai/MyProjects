Mosquitoes alone spread malaria in nature. (The disease can be transmitted unnaturally through shared needles or by blood transfusion from infected donors.) When a mosquito bites an infected individual, the sporozoan's male and female sexual stages, or gametocytes, are taken up in the blood meal. Fertilization ensues in the mosquito's gut, and an "ookinete" forms.
