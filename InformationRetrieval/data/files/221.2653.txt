Typhus is treated with antibiotics. Medication may also be prescribed to reduce fever (antipyretics) and relieve muscle aches (analgesics). Severe headaches may require a narcotic pain reliever. Bed rest is necessary for recovery. Any remaining lice, fleas, or mites should be removed and the individual isolated in a clean environment free from rodents. Supportive care may be necessary depending on the involvement of other organ systems. Although symptoms may recur, they are usually responsive to antibiotic therapy.
Physical exam: Rash is the major physical finding upon physical examination. Lymph nodes may be enlarged. The individual may show signs of delirium or stupor. Typhus affects many organs, including the intestines, liver, heart, kidneys, and brain. As these organs are affected, corresponding pathology may include constipation, pneumonia, enlargement of the liver or spleen (splenomegaly), kidney damage (renal failure), or slowed heartbeat (bradycardia).
