A "mysterious" disease began silently spreading in a small village in Guinea on 26 December 2013 but was not identified as Ebola until 21 March 2014.
CHAPTER 2 - Retrospective studies conducted by WHO staff and Guinean health officials identified the index case in West Africa’s Ebola epidemic as an 18-month-old boy who lived in Meliandou, Guinea. The boy developed an illness characterized by fever, black stools, and vomiting on 26 December 2013 and died two days later. The exact source of his infection has not been identified but likely involved contact with wild animals.
