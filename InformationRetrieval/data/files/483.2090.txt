Well, it isn’t really. Not directly, anyway. I know this doesn’t sound very encouraging, but the best course of action is to give the patient support. Intravenous fluids will prevent dehydration, keeping the patient cool can mitigate the effects of the fever, pain relievers can add some degree of comfort, and health officials will also monitor oxygen levels as well as blood pressure. There is not currently a vaccine to prevent EVD.
