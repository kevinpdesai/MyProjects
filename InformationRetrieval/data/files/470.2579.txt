Special populations including pregnant or lactating women and children <5 kilograms require directed treatment after diagnostic testing and thus should not receive presumptive therapy. Individuals in these groups who lack signs and symptoms of malaria but have laboratory-diagnosed Plasmodium falciparum infection should be treated with either a combination of oral quinine and clindamycin (preferred) or a longer course of oral quinine.
