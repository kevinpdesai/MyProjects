Guinea was the starting point of the current outbreak of Ebola. Scientists believe that the virus started its deadly journey there in December 2013. The first confirmed case was a two-year-old toddler who died in the village of Meliandou in the south-eastern part of the country. Soon after, his mother, sister and grandmother passed away, too. From their village, the virus quickly spread through the country. On March 24th, the Guinean ministry of health informed the World Health Organization of 59 confirmed Ebola deaths. "This epidemic just killed our health system," the Guinean minister for health, Remy Lama, told DW's French service. "A health system that, even beforehand, lacked the qualified staff and equipment needed to take care of such an outbreak."
