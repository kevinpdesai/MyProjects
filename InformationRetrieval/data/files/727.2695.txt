This fever may assume from the commencement the form of Typhus, or, as is very often the case, especially under the prostrating treatment of the Allopathic school, other varieties of fever may run into this low sinking and more dangerous malady. Besides the two forms already mentioned, there are three forms of Typhus, more or less distinct, notwithstanding the general symptoms may be the same. These are:
1. Cerebral Typhus, or Typhus cerebralis, affecting principally the brain and the nervous system

2. Typhus Abdominalis or abdominal Typhus, where some part of the abdomen is the principal seat of the disease.

3. Pneumo Typhus, or Typhus of the lungs. Typhoid lung fever, or Typhoid Pneumonia, affecting the organs of the chest.
