Until this month, Ebola has remained in central Africa, specifically, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Gabon, and Republic of Congo, with two additional outbreaks in Ivory Coast (one case) and in South Africa (two cases). On March 23, the World Health Organization reported, via Guinea's Ministry of Health, that the outbreak plaguing the Guéckédou, Macenta, Nzerekore and Kissidougou districts of southeastern Guinea is caused by Ebola. This is the first time that Ebola has been recorded in Guinea.  - See more at: http://www.healthmap.org/site/diseasedaily/article/first-recorded-cases-ebola-guinea-32314#sthash.zD4b854R.dpuf
