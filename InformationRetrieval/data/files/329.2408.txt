WH: When you say “contact with body fluids,” what exactly does that mean? If the fluids get on your skin? Or do they have to go into a cut or a mucus membrane, like into your eyes or something? Dr. Lahey: That’s the big concern, is getting a splash to the eyes is the big thing you worry about. I actually have not seen specific data on whether someone with Ebola whose body fluids get on completely intact skin, compared to a wound. I haven’t seen that type of direct comparison. The precautions that the CDC gives out say that providers should use gowns regardless of whether they have a wound or not. The safe option is to presume that any contact with body fluids confers some risk of transmission. But I think we’d all be most worried about contact that involves mucus membranes like mouth or eyes.
