Vibrio cholerae is a dangerous opponent. To cause the severe diarrhea in cholera,
V. cholerae releases CT toxin to obstruct the
phospholipids of erythrocytes and causes the
intestinal capillaries to be porous. The CT
toxin attaches itself to the intestinal
epithelium and releases an enzyme activated
subunit, which dramatically increases
the amount of cAMP production in the
body, causing abundant release of
water and electrolytes into the intestines. The intestines are irritated by V. cholerae’s
toxins to the point that it starts to release profuse amounts of fluids, while the epithelial
cells of the intestines are slowly being eroded. The affected epithelial cells die, and
eventually form scaly mounds that peel off from their original bases. This is followed by
the opening of the capillaries and the release of fluids from the vessels and into the
neighboring tissues. The destruction of the intestinal walls and capillary leakage cause
fluid accumulation in the body, hence the severe diarrheal symptom of cholera
