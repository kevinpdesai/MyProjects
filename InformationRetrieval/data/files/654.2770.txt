The Trexler negative-pressure plastic isolator and the techniques used for the disposal of waste proved to be effective in preventing spread of Ebola virus from the patient to attendant staff and to the general community. Of the 24 nurses who were directly concerned in the care of the patient, six became ill with acute respiratory infections, which lasted on average two days. Four of the five doctors looking after the patient developed a 'flu-like' illness with some gastrointestinal symptoms. At onset these illnesses caused concern but the problems invariably resolved within two or three days and antibody studies later showed no evidence of Ebola virus infection among either medical or nursing staff.
