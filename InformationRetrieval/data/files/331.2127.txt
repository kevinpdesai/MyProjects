 In general, to survive, viruses must find a host cell and take it over. The virus also replicates itself so that it can be spread to other host cells. In response to a virus, the human body produces antibodies. "Antibodies are the protein 'workhorses' of the immune system; in less severe infections (like the flu), antibodies stop the virus from spreading and help clear it from the body. The problem with Ebola is that the virus spreads so rapidly that it can easily overcome the body's immune response," said Jonathan Lai, associate professor of biochemistry at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York.
