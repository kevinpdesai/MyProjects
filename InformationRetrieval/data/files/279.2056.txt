Since the Ebola virus was first identified almost 40 years ago, the World Health Organization reports 24 previous outbreaks of Ebola and its subtypes.
The first reported outbreaks occurred in 1976. In the central African nation then known as Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 318 people got sick, and 280 of them -- 88 percent -- died. The outbreak originated in a small village called Yambuku, near the Ebola River for which the virus is named.
