the clinical manifestations of cholera are the result of the isotonic dehydration induced by a potent enterotoxin. The dehydration ranges in severity from none to severe. Onset of the disease is sudden and characterized by profuse watery diarrhea without strain, tenesmus, or prominent abdominal pain, rapidly followed or sometimes preceded by vomiting. As the diarrhea keeps on, other symptoms of severe dehydration arise, such as generalized cramps and oliguria. Physical examination will show an alert patient, fever is observed in less than 5% of cases, the eyes are very sunken, mucous membranes are dry, the skin has lost its elasticity and when pinched retracts very slowly, the voice is almost nonaudible, and the intestinal sounds are prominent. This status of severe dehydration is seldom caused by any other pathogen. Laboratory abnormalities result from the isotonic dehydration and include increase in packed cell volume, serum specific gravity, and total proteins. Biochemical and acid-base laboratory abnormalities typical of severe dehydration are prerenal azotemia, metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap, normal or low serum potassium levels, and normal or slightly low sodium and chloride levels. Hyperglycemia caused by high concentrations of epinephrine, glucagon, and cortisol stimulated by hypovolemia is more commonly seen than hypoglycemia (10). Acute renal failure is the most severe complication of cholera. All age groups are at risk to develop this complication, but the mortality rate is higher particularly among the elderly (40).
