Four weeks of hell
Dr. Kent Brantly's first symptom was a mild fever. By the time he tested positive for Ebola in a Liberian health-care facility a few days later, the Samaritan's Purse missionary had lost his appetite and was overwhelmed with nausea. "I didn't think, This is it, I'm dead," he said, "but it was very sobering to realize that I may die right here in my bedroom." Brantly's fever passed 104, the diarrhea and vomiting began, and the 33-year-old spent the next few days trying to stay hydrated as he lost more than 2 gallons of fluids a day. Soon, his near-continual diarrhea turned black, and his vomit turned purple — signs that the virus was damaging the walls of his blood vessels, causing internal bleeding. When he started struggling to breathe, the father of two called his wife to say goodbye. Thankfully, his farewell proved premature. After he was given a dose of ZMapp, his condition improved, and the next day he was flown to Atlanta for treatment. After 19 days in intensive care, Brantly walked out of the hospital, having beaten Ebola.
