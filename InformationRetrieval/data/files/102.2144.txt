Favipiravir was given to a French nurse from Doctors without Borders. More than 10,000 treatment doses of this drug may be available, but it isn't approved by the U.S. to treat Ebola. It is an anti-viral drug approved in Japan for flu treatment, and would need high doses if used for Ebola. It has been shown to help mice survive, but only 1-in-6 monkeys responded to the tested dosage.
