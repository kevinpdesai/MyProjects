ZMapp, which is produced by San Diego-based company Mapp Biopharmaceutical, has already been used in the successful treatment of five patients, including British nurse Will Pooley, Dr Kent Brantly, Nancy Writebol and two Liberians who became the first Africans to receive the drug.
Of the seven people who have been treated with ZMapp, only two have died.
