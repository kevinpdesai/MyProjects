 As of February 2015 a number of experimental treatments are undergoing clinical trials.[279][280][281] One of these, Favipiravir (Avigan), was successful in initial trials and authorities in Guinea have approved its wider use.[282] On 1 February 2015, a clinical drug trial in Liberia was halted due to lack of patients. Health authorities have also reported that the falling number of patients may affect the plans for the testing of the experimental drug ZMapp and two vaccines as well.
