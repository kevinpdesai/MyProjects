A single-celled parasite known as a sporozoan causes malaria. This sporozoan belongs to the genus Plasmodium, and the four species that threaten humans are P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. vivax and P. ovale. Of these four, P. falciparum and P. vivax are the most common, and P. falciparum is by far the most dangerous.
