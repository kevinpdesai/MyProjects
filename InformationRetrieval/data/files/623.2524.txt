From the total of 80 patients seen in the clinic during the study time, with confirmed diagnosis of
malaria, 49 (63%) were infected with P. vivax. Between those, seven had an estimated incubation period varying
from three to 12 months and were returned travellers from Brazilian Amazonian states (6) and Indonesia (1). None
of them had taken malarial chemoprophylaxis.
