Alphonse Laveran, a French army doctor, described the malarial parasite--and proposed that it caused malaria--in 1880. But the final piece of the puzzle was put into place by a British physician, Sir Ronald Ross, who was working in India in 1897 when he observed the development of oocysts in mosquitoes that had been fed on infected individuals. Ross's description of the complete life cycle of the malarial parasite won him the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1902.
