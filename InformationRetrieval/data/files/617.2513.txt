After an incubation period of about one week, a person infected with typhus develops a headache, chills, prostration, and fever up to 104° F. Other symptoms include a rash, conjunctivitis (inflammation of the mucous membrane that lines the inner surface of the eyelids and covers the forepart of the eyeball), and a dry cough.
