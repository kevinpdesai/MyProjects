The species of virus at the heart of the outbreak, Zaire ebolavirus has historically been thought to have the highest fatality rate of all Ebola species, up to 90%. Although it is difficult to accurately pinpoint a case fatality rate (CFR) in the middle of an outbreak, it appears that the CFR in the current outbreak is closer to 50%. While still alarmingly high, prompt reporting of cases and rapid administration of aggressive supportive care are likely helping to curb mortality in some areas. Moreover, outbreaks historically have been relatively short-lived with high mortality early on, before the etiologic agent was recognized and proper public health measures (isolation, contact tracing, careful use of personal protective equipment) initiated. In longer outbreaks, the CFR has been observed to fall over time, as has been seen in the current outbreak in West Africa.
