Cholera, caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, sickens millions of people every year. It's usually preventable with adequate sanitation, but can easily become a major problem when local water treatment facilities have been damaged.
Electrolyte replacement is generally effective, if started early. If not, antibiotics may be advisable, because the mortality rate of untreated cholera exceeds 50%.
