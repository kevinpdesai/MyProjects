How does the Vibrio cholerae bacterium affect the body?
The bacterium that causes cholera is usually very sensitive to the acids present in the stomach and digestive tract. Small amounts of bacteria are killed by the stomach acids before they can establish themselves in the body. Approximately 75 percent of people infected will not develop any symptoms; however, the bacteria is still present in their feces for seven to 14 days, during which time they can infect other people, particularly if they have poor personal hygiene habits. Eighty percent of people who do develop symptoms will develop a mild to moderate gastroenteritis. The remaining 20 percent of those infected will develop severe cholera with profuse watery diarrhea referred to as "rice-water stools," and sometimes vomiting, both of which lead to severe dehydration. Signs and symptoms may include tachycardia (a very rapid heart rate), dry mucous membranes, hypotension (a very low blood pressure), and muscle cramps. If untreated, the severe dehydration can ultimately lead to shock and death. People with weakened immune systems are at greater risk for dying from cholera infection.
