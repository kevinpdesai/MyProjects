Cholera is caused by a specific bacterium, Vibrio cholerae.
When an adequate quantity of the bacteria has passed into the stomach in food, they accumulate and begin to produce poisonous substances (toxins). It's the toxin that causes the symptoms of the disease.
The cholera toxin has the unpleasant ability to affect the cells of the gastrointestinal tract, so that the affected person doesn't just get ordinary diarrhoea but also starts to lose large quantities of fluid. It's this fluid loss that can be serious.s
