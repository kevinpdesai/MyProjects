 The distribution of incubation times for the Chowell analysis of the Uganda outbreak shows a more rapid incubation time than any of the other outbreaks. At a 21 day quarantine period, using the data sets other than the Congo analysis of Chowell, three Congo data analyses, the probability of exceedance is between 1.9 and 12%. In other words from 0.1 to 12% of the time, an individual case will have a greater incubation time than 21 days. The 0.1% stems from the 1976 Zaire outbreak, which has the fewest cases analyzed than any of the others in Figure 2. It is clear that the method of analysis as well as choice of the form of the incubation time distribution are influential.
