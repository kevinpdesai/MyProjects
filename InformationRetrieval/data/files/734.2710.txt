Vibrio cholerae kills bacteria common to the human gastrointestinal tract. Getting rid of competing bacteria may help it gain a competitive advantage, and aid the spread of cholera outbreaks.
It remains to be proven whether Vibrio cholera attacks other bacteria outside of a controlled laboratory experiment, enabling proliferation at the expense of other microbial life. If so, scientists may have a means of vanquishing cholera, possibly by attacking the type VI secretion system or by uncovering how cholera defends against itself.
