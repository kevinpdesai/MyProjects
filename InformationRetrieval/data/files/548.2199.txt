Cholera is an infectious diarrhoeal disease caused by Vibrio cholerae. The earliest western record of cholera dates back to at least 16th century, when cases were observed in India [1], but global pandemics of “asiatic cholera” were first documented in 1817. Cholera can be endemic or epidemic, and is a disease with pandemic potential, with pandemics occurring as a result of genetic reassortment microbial strains [2]; the seventh recorded cholera pandemic occurred in the 1960s
