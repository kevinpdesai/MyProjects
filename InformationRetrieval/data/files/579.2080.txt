The variations they identified were frequently in regions of the genome encoding proteins. Some of the genetic variation detected in these studies may affect the primers (starting points for DNA synthesis) used in PCR-based diagnostic tests, emphasizing the importance of genomic surveillance and the need for vigilance.
To accelerate response efforts, the research team released the full-length sequences on National Center for Biotechnology Information’s (NCBI’s) DNA sequence database in advance of publication, making these data available to the global scientific community.
