The parasites develop in the intestine and salivary glands of the mosquito and can be passed on to other people the next time the mosquito bites.
In man, the parasite travels to the liver via the blood and then out into the bloodstream again, where it invades the red blood corpuscles (the cells which carry oxygen in the blood).
