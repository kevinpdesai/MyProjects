Researchers are still trying to ascertain how Ebola originated, exactly how it spreads, and how to stop it. They know that people can be infected by coming into contact with sick or dead animals, such as chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, and monkeys, that were infected in the forest. Humans can then pass along the virus by exchanging bodily fluids. Additionally, burial rituals in some communities, in which people have direct contact with a deceased person, may also spread Ebola.
