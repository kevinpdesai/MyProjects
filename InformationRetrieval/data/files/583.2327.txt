Most of the U.S. patients began treatment at the first sign of infection. In West Africa, so many patients have died in Ebola treatment centers that people fear them and thus do not get medical help until they're gravely ill — at which point their organs are failing and the viral load is too large for their bodies to fight off. American hospitals are also much better at preventing the spread of infection to their health workers. When Atlanta's Emory Hospital became overwhelmed by the amount of Ebola-contaminated waste, it immediately installed an industrial-size autoclave, which uses pressure and 275-degree heat to sterilize any kind of material. Field hospitals in West Africa tend not to have autoclaves.
