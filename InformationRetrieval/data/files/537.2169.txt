 Ebola virus and Marburg virus glycoprotein DNA vaccines induce immune response when given alone or together (level 3 [lacking direct] evidence)
based on randomized trial without clinical outcomes
108 healthy volunteers received intramuscular injections at weeks 0, 4, and 8
during part 1, 72 patients were randomized to Ebola virus vaccine only (encoding Zaire and Sudan glycoproteins) vs. Marburg virus vaccine only (encoding Marburg virus glycoprotein) vs. placebo
during part 2, 36 patients were randomized to Ebola virus vaccine plus Marburg virus vaccine vs. placebo
antibody and T-cell response measured 4 weeks after third vaccination
