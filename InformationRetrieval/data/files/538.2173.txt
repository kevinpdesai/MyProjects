With some types of malaria, the fever occurs in four-to-eight hour cycles. You feel cold at first with shivering that lasts for up to an hour. You then develop a fever that lasts for two-to-six hours, accompanied by severe sweating.
Seek medical advice immediately if you develop the symptoms of malaria, even if it is several weeks, months or a year after you return from travelling.
