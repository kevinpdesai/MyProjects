Liberia: In a statement, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) on 17 April announced the handing over of the ELWA 3 Ebola management center in Monrovia to the Liberian Ministry of Health. The ELWA 3 was closed down on 25 March in view of decrease in number of Ebola cases in the country. At this time, the facility has 30 beds but has the ability to increase further to 60 beds in case of need. At the peak of the outbreak, it had a capacity of 250 beds and was the largest management centre that was built.

From the time of opening the centre on 17 August 2014 until 10 March 2015, more than 1,910 patients were admitted to ELWA 3, of which around 1,230 tested positive for Ebola.
