The first and perhaps most important difference between the current Ebola outbreak and the the 2009 H1N1 pandemic is that Ebola it is very slow moving. For example, the first case of Ebola is thought to have occurred 307 days ago on December 6th in a two-year old boy. Since that time there have been an estimated 8,032 cases (granted these could be underestimates).
