Treatment of cholera is based on replacement of fluids lost through diarrhea by oral or, in severe cases, intravenous rehydration. Antibiotics, such as tetracycline , can shorten the duration of diarrhea and reduce the period of carriage. However, antibiotic therapy should always be regarded as ancillary to vigorous rehydration. It also should be recognized that many epidemic strains are resistant to recommended antibiotics.
