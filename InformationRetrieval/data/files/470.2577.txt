Malaria was endemic in most of the continental United States and much of Europe into the 20th century. Most of the continental United States has Anopheles mosquitoes (particularly An. quadramaculatus and An. freeborni) which are competent vectors under favorable conditions. Local U.S. vector-borne transmission has resulted in 156 known malaria cases in 63 U.S. outbreaks over the past 50 years. 12 In addition, more than 1000 cases of malaria are reported annually in the U.S. with migration playing an important role in the importation of these cases. 34 56
