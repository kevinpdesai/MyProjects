A person is contagious during the hepatitis B incubation period. A person who is infected with hepatitis B begins to be contagious early in the incubation period. About one-half of people remain contagious for up to two months after hepatitis B symptoms begin. The remainder of people who do not develop chronic hepatitis B will remain contagious for up to 15 weeks after symptoms begin. If a person develops chronic hepatitis B, they will remain contagious indefinitely.
