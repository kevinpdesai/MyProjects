Once the acute stage had subsided it was decided to take specimens for clearance tests at weekly intervals and it was arbitrarily agreed that three negative sets of cultures from throat swabs, blood, urine and faeces would be an acceptable standard for discharging the patient from isolation. After two sets of specimens had been shown to be free from virus the patient was removed from the isolator and transferred to a high-security room equipped with airfiltration and facilities for the safe disposal of excreta. He remained there pending the results of the third set of clearance specimens. Altogether he had spent 32 days in the isolator.
