Typhus is a type of mite. It is also known as chiggers or lice. Even with great hand washing and hygiene, you may acquire typhus from your roommate. Permethrin in the form of a dust or spray to clothing and bedding is highly effective against lice. Fabric treated with permethrin retains toxicity to lice even after 20 washings.
