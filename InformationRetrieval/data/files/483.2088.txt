It is not entirely clear where the virus originated, though it is thought that bats might harbor the virus in their intestinal tract. It is likely that the virus made the transmission to primates through ingestion. The first humans to be infected and spread the disease likely went hunting and ate an infected animal. Bats, pigs, and dogs are all believed to be reservoirs for the virus. The first human outbreaks were in Sudan. Out of the 284 people infected in the first outbreaks, 151 died from the disease; 53 percent.
