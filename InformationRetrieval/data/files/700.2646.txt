In order to effectively spread the parasite around the body, it must pass the immune system. Sometimes, a common disease is recognized by the immune system and it will react by defending against the disease because it knows how to from a previous infection due to the immune system's memory cells. If only it was the same for malaria. Unfortunately, plasmodium falciparum can easily trick the immune system by avoiding detection. How? According to a study at HSHP (Harvard School of Public Health) the parasite can change a protein on its service, which helps it to indulge inside an erythrocyte and hide from the immunity defense system. There is a 'switch-like' mechanism inside the parasite's nucleus that can turn on and off at high frequencies; this changing the protein which makes it alter its presence. When the parasite inhabits a new red blood cell, it can return to its natural biological structure and reproduce.
